         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAſt thou not read, that in the days of Chriſt, a Romane Senator abiding at JERUSA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEM, and wondering at his vertuous Life and Miracles, ſent to the Senate
<pb facs="tcp:169498:3"/>
at <hi>Rome</hi> to receive Jeſus for a God? They put it to the Queſtion; and in the end voted, That <hi>Rome</hi> could not receive Jeſus for a God, becauſe He admitted of no more Gods but Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: And that whoſoever would not accept of him alone, upon his own terms, which was, to leave all, and follow him, was not worthy of him. But the Worſhip of <hi>Rome</hi> conſiſted of many, and therefore Jeſus and their gods could not ſtand together; and accordingly rejected him, and left him to be tryed for his Life by the Law. We have a Law, and by this he ought to dye, ſaid the People.</p>
            <p>Reader, That People are not dead to this day: And to this day, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Man, Sect, or People, ſhall profeſs that Name of Jeſus accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Law left in his Goſpel, he muſt be baptized into his Cup, hated of all Men for that Name
<pb facs="tcp:169498:3"/>
ſake, reproached, perſecuted.</p>
            <p>The Portion of the true Remnant in all ages: and in this day the very condition of this deſpiſed Sect with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a name, the People of ELY: judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all, known of none, owned of none; a ſhame to be for it, a danger to be of it, a ſin to be in it: But well; They whom Jew, Greek, and Roman refuſed, do this People ſeek after for a God; And accordingly think no rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion dear unto them, if poſſibly they may attain to his Croſs, and be found worthy to drink of his Cup toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>And for this Cauſe, for this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and this Practice, are they call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Queſtion, at this day, in this preſent year 1651. both Miniſter and People, after twenty years faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in the Goſpel, day and night decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this Name; And accordingly ſtand indicted (as is publickly known) for an
<pb facs="tcp:169498:4"/>
unlawful and moſt uncivil Aſſembly, gathered and united contrary to the Laws of this Commonwealth. How unjuſt and erroneous this ſcandal is, is well known to them that lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the burthen; and to him that is able to clear them in his own way and day.</p>
            <p>In the mean ſpace, friendly Reader, they thought it their duty, in the midſt of theſe diſtractions, to endevor a right apprehenſion of their Way and Life; and as much as in them lieth, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the block of offence, which is for the moſt part no other then Ignorance, and a miſunderſtanding of them; the very cauſe that too many ſpeak too headily, and fall too foully on them: As for them that ſpeak evil through malice, they may go on till they be met with.</p>
            <p>But becauſe that ſome eminent and much honored perſons, with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb facs="tcp:169498:4"/>
in afflicted conditions of ſpirit, have earneſtly deſired to ſee ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration come forth in publique, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting their Practice and Doctrine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The People have given their joynt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to print this ſmall Volume of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, or Collections rather, (being only the faithful gleanings of a diligent hand after a full vintage) as a true and ſome ſmall Teſtimony of them by it. By the Doctrine thou mayſt know the People, and by the People the Doctrine, as a Banner of Truth diſplayed; the Enſign ſtands open, the Colours are flying, the Motto is, Love and Truth. He that runs if he have eyes, may read. If that be not ſufficient, to run and read; then come and ſee: peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture an Interpreter may be joyned to thy Charet; and beſides, thou knoweſt not what good may come out of <hi>Nazareth.</hi> Reader, I ſpeak as a Witneſs and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſher both, having made certain tryal,
<pb facs="tcp:169498:5"/>
That to be the accepted Servant of this deſpiſed People, this Houſe of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is an Honor this World cannot give; a Mercy of Mercies; to be prized before all conditions of glory in Place or Court. Farewel.</p>

                     <q>Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Promiſes, &amp;c.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THree things in general I would this day open to you. 1. What are theſe exceeding great and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Promiſes. 2. What it is to be partakers of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature. 3. Who they are that ſhall be partakers both of the precious Promiſes and Divine Nature: not all men, all are not fitted for it; but ſuch <hi>as have eſcaped the corruption of the world through luſt.</hi> For there is a great deal in us that ſeems to be for God, which is but <hi>luſt,</hi> if well examined: the Heart of man is full of cheats, and deceitful above meaſure; but God will not be mocked: none ſhall partake of his Nature and Being but ſuch as have eſcaped luſt: He will have no fellowſhip with the ſtool of iniquity.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, What are theſe exceeding great and precious Promiſes? <hi>Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious Promiſes:</hi> The words have relation to the foregoing Verſe; <hi>According as his divine power hath given us all things that pertain to life and godlineſs, through the knowledg of Him that hath called us to glory and vertue:</hi> Where four things are layd down, in which theſe precious Promiſes are fulfilled; <hi>Life, God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, Glory, Vertue.</hi> Theſe are the exceeding great things promiſed to be, though not yet attained: For it is one thing to have a <hi>Promiſe given,</hi> and another to ſee <hi>the accompliſhment of it:</hi> as Chriſt ſaith to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>I will ſend you the promiſe of my Father:</hi> the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt was promiſed before, but yet to be ſent by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:169498:10"/>1. The firſt thing promiſed, to which you are called, is <hi>Life,</hi> as the promiſe was to <hi>Sarah,</hi> That according to the time of Life God would ſurely viſit her, and ſhe ſhould conceive, &amp;c. The Spirit of Life is promiſed to you, though yet the Thing is to be accompliſhed: For how do we lie at preſent in our graves? like Dead men long out of minde? how dry and deſolate and waſte, becauſe the Spirit of Life, that ſhould quicken and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liven, is not come! The time of Life is not accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but the promiſe is gone forth, that at the ſet time He will ſurely viſit <hi>Sarah,</hi> and the dry womb ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; though <hi>Abrahams</hi> body be dead, and <hi>Sarahs</hi> womb dead, and all ſeem to work to the contrary: For great is the deſolation now upon us; We are ſealed in our graves under death; but yet this is the promiſe, That <hi>the Dead ſhal hear the Voyce of the Son of God, and live:</hi> And This is an exceeding large and precious Promiſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Life</hi> implies in it a <hi>freedom from death,</hi> a reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and deliverance out of its power: Alas, to <hi>Live</hi> is another manner of thing then we have conceived it! We have gone about, and acted, and ſpoke like living men; but have we Lived in all this! have we been yet ever acquitted and freed from fears of death? <hi>The Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of Death made me afraid</hi> (ſaith <hi>David.)</hi> Are you not yet kept all your life time under this fear of Death? You can never have reſt nor quiet becauſe the Jaylor is ever at your heels: you are not yet freed from him. <hi>Death reigned,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>from Adam to Moſes:</hi> now <hi>Adam</hi> was made a Living Soul: He had a life to ſee and know good and evil, but yet he could not come at it, could not reach the Tree of life; a ſword was ſet to keep him off there: But the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> is a quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit, He hath life in Himſelf; He was raiſed up by the power of God, never to dye more: and this is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:169498:11"/>
life indeed. Now how many in the World are there that never yet came to be Living Souls! to have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and light to know good and evil! but when brought to that, yet there is no freedom from Death: <hi>Death reigns from Adam to Moſes;</hi> to that farther light, which comes in by the Law opened and read to the Soul: <hi>When the Commandment came</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) ſin revived, and I dyed:</hi> Death yet reigned. And now to be freed from this cruel Tyrant, from eternal Death, and to be made partakers of Life, is an exceeding great and precious mercy: Who can value it!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Man that is alive, is capable of inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and teaching;</hi> He can hear and learn from others: but <hi>the Dead know nothing at all</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon:)</hi> while we lie dead in darkneſs, fears, unbelief, faintings of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; ſo long we know nothing, hear nothing; we are capable of nothing of the minde of God: All is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed and without order in this land of Death. What is the reaſon (think you) there is ſuch a ſtupid, ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, careleſs Heart upon you; not an ecchoing back, as was in <hi>Davids</hi> Heart; When Thou ſaidſt, <hi>Seek my face,</hi> My Heart anſwered, <hi>Thy face Lord will I ſeek?</hi> Why is not this minde, and quickneſs, and breathings of Truth in you? Why, you are <hi>dead:</hi> Death reigns, ſin hath dominion; you are not yet freed from that body of Death: For were you but alive, it were impoſſible but you ſhould hear the voyce of the Son of God: Truth would touch you; and that is the firſt thing to be done, <hi>to give you life,</hi> and then ſenſe and hearing will follow. But you are now as unſenſible at times as a poſt in the houſe; and therefore you come and go, and come and go, and nothing is done; why? becauſe you are under <hi>death:</hi> It is not yet the time of <hi>Life;</hi> and He will make us know we cannot quicken our own ſouls. <hi>Adam</hi> would
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:169498:11"/>
have been reaching to the Tree of Life when his Eyes were opened to know Good and Evil: I, but a flaming ſword is ſet, turning every way, to keep the Tree of Life: and if ever <hi>Adam</hi> live again, it muſt be upon other terms; He muſt be raiſed by <hi>another power,</hi> and that freely of gift: For he is now a dead man, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not quicken his own Soul, unleſs that <hi>quickening ſpirit of Life</hi> be put within: and here lies the great ſtrait, to lie at the mercy of another, whether He will ever again give life or not; and if he will, yet it muſt be in his own time too, and not ours: and therefore the Church is at a ſtrait, and complains, There was none could tell her <hi>how long:</hi> How long we muſt lie in the duſt, in our graves, before Life ſhall be given, we know not: <hi>we cannot get it out of his hand.</hi> Truth <hi>would never be good and ſweet</hi> if we could <hi>attain it</hi> by our <hi>reachings.</hi> Many may preſs in to take the Kingdom by violence and ſtealth, but the <hi>Examiner will come;</hi> Friend, how came you in hither? But of a certain this Promiſe of Life is given to ſome of us; <hi>Hear O Earth, for the Lord hath ſpoken:</hi> The word is gone forth, that you ſhall ſurely be viſited at the Time of Life; and till this be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed you cannot be capable of inſtruction: <hi>Your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and thoughts cannot reach it,</hi> but are to ſit ſilent in your graves till Chriſt ſhall call, <hi>Lazarus, come forth;</hi> and ſo life be given and put within: and this will be an eternal Life, never to dye any more; Death is no more to have dominion, but yet it reigns. This is your hour (ſaith Chriſt) and the power of darkneſs; and whileſt this government is up, and thoſe noiſes of Hell are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, we cannot hear the voyce of Truth; till the Soul is freed from the ſtormy wind and tempeſt, and a calm be made. We many times go about <hi>to quicken our ſelves,</hi> and get life at our own hands, and ſo reach <hi>up
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:169498:12"/>
hopes,</hi> and <hi>concluſions,</hi> and <hi>promiſes</hi> to bear up a while: but alaſs! all muſt down again; we muſt to our center, to our graves, till <hi>the ſpirit of Life</hi> be put in. We are asking what we ſhould do, and what is our way? as if then we could eaſily turn and do it; but alaſs, there is a miſtake in the bottom, Life muſt firſt be given us, and we muſt reſt in our graves till then, and ſit in ſilence in our darkneſs and bonds till we are freed; and that is our way, if indeed we would know it: but how fooliſh and prepoſterous are we! we would be walking before we are made alive. But then,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A man that is alive, as He is capable of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and teaching, ſo he is fit for any employment, to ſpeak, and walk, and act what is ſet before him: He may run the ways of Gods Commandments; He may ſpeak well of God: <hi>The Living He ſhall praiſe thee</hi> (ſaith <hi>Hezekiah:) The father to the children ſhall make known thy Truth:</hi> Then indeed there will be a capableneſs of that other precious Promiſe, to be <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of Godlineſs,</hi> to walk with God, to be of his Councel. But now is a dead man fit company for God? Can God have fellowſhip with ſuch as lie ſtinking in their graves? Is there any communion to be had with dry bones? Can you have any content and pleaſure in a dead mans preſence? No: you muſt firſt be <hi>partakers of Life,</hi> before you can <hi>partake of Godlineſs;</hi> to have his minde and nature and diſpoſition in you. God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſpeak to the people, not to break into the Mount to gaze, leſt they were deſtroyed: We are reaching to come neer and neer, and plead for it, to be taken in to know the minde and counſels of Truth: Alaſs, we are not fit! Can we dwell with everlaſting burning? Can we come neer God, and not be conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med? Alaſs! we know not what we have deſired: The
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:169498:12"/>
old bottles would burſt in pieces if this new wine ſhould be put in. There muſt be a new Life given before that new minde can grow: Before we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>n partake of <hi>godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> to have that God-like minde in all things, to love Juſtice and Mercy, and walk humbly with our God, we muſt firſt be Living Men: And it is but yet <hi>a promiſe to us,</hi> though it be exceeding great and precious; the <hi>Thing is yet to be done:</hi> and therefore that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us at preſent, is, to ſit ſtill in our graves, in our bonds and darkneſs and ſorrows, till He calls us; as They told the blind man; <hi>Be of good cheer, for He call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Thee:</hi> In the mean time it is in vain, and dangerous for us, to run and gaze.</p>
                  <p>Theſe precious Promiſes are not made to all; I would not have you all thruſt in as ſharers: you may come and gaze for faſhion-ſake, but I know there are among you in whom the love of God is not; as Chriſt ſaid to the <hi>Jews;</hi> I know you have not the love of God abiding in you: You come not out of a love to Truth, or minde to be inſtructed, but either as to hear a matter of news, or to lie at catch to make a miſchief. Therefore beware what you do, God will not be mocked by you; It is dangerous tampering in Holy things with a deceitful heart; we have payd dearly for it amongſt us: and He will ſurely divide between thoughts and intentions, and ſeparate betwixt the ſheep and the goats. He hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed promiſed all things belonging to <hi>Life, Godlineſs, Glory</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> but to whom? <hi>Whereby are given TO <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>exceeding great and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Promiſes: TO <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> and not to all. And,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Promiſe of <hi>Life;</hi> I told you what it was to Live: to be freed of all ſnares and bonds and fears of Death, which keep down the Soul a cloſe Priſoner, that it can ſtir neither hand nor foot: But <hi>none will come in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:169498:13"/>
here</hi> but ſuch as are cloſe hunted and put out of all their holes and ſhiftings, that they can no ways get Life at their own hand: For ſo long as there is any fhift, that we can either get up hopes, or prayers, or deſires, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions of our own; ſo long we are not dead men; as God ſaith, <hi>Thou haſt abaſed thy ſelf to Hell, yet haſt Thou not ſaid, There is no hope:</hi> And till a man be dead, there is no need of raiſing Him to Life: and now to live, is to be brought out of the grave, and recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this free word of Promiſe. You all live, and walk, and act, but upon what terms? Is it by this Promiſe of <hi>Life</hi> given to <hi>Abraham?</hi> Have <hi>your lives been given you?</hi> Have you been raiſed up by the ſame power that raiſed up Jeſus? Chriſt ſaith, <hi>All that the Father hath given me ſhall come unto me; and I will raiſe them up at the laſt day:</hi> They ſhall be <hi>raiſed up;</hi> and when? at the <hi>laſt day,</hi> not preſently: The beſt wine is not brought out firſt, but at the laſt Day: <hi>When Chriſt who is your Life ſhall appear, then ſhall you alſo appear with him in glory:</hi> and this is an exceeding precious Promiſe indeed, to as many as God hath given it; but not by any's thruſting themſelves in that were never bidden: The King will come and look over his gueſts, and finde the man without the wedding garment.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond great and precious Promiſe is of <hi>Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> to have a God-like minde, to be Juſt, Patient, Merciful, Single, Holy as God is Holy, &amp;c. to be know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in the <hi>light</hi> as he is in the <hi>light;</hi> to be faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the very minde of the Father. This is <hi>godlineſs</hi> that hath great gain belonging to it, having the promiſes of this life and that which is to come; to ſubmit thus, to be God-like in all things, to pray indeed, <hi>Thy Will be done in Earth, as it is in Heaven;</hi> We would have our <hi>wills reign and be done in Heaven,</hi> as they are in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:169498:13"/>
                     <hi>Earth:</hi> We would have Gods minde come to ours, and Heaven ſtoop to Earth: There is ſomething yet dear to us that we ſave and keep alive, and would not every where and in all caſes be like to God: But this is the onely happineſs and content, to attain this <hi>life of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> for a people to joyn together in one heart and Soul, ſtrengthening and building up one another in their moſt holy Faith, provoking one another to good works, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the good of one another as their own, and ready to lay down their lives for their Brother. How many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have we ſeen in our day to change and altar their <hi>Gods</hi> according to their own thoughts and imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons! as the complaint was againſt <hi>Iſrael; According to thy Cities, ſo are thy Gods, O Iſrael;</hi> ſuch a chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, toſſing, and variable thing is in the heart of man: but where the minde of God is planted, and ſpreads it ſelf forth in the Soul, and makes it partaker of <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> that is a ſtanding <hi>principle,</hi> abiding for ever.</p>

A third great and precious promiſe is, to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of <hi>Glory;</hi> There is a glory that follows and flows from <hi>godlineſs;</hi> Moſes <hi>face ſhone when he came down from God:</hi> and the Church in her worſt day, yet ſays of her ſelf, <hi>I am black, but comely:</hi> and Chriſt yet owns and calls Her, <hi>O thou faireſt among women!</hi> And I am confident, however we are found in our ſelves weak and fooliſh, and ſinners; yet we <hi>ſit</hi> in the <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi> of our <hi>worſt Enemies,</hi> if they would ſpeak their hearts freely, That ſure we are beyond them, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſter then They: There is ſomething that judges, and gets above them, do what they can: and however they envy, hate, and oppoſe, and will not ſtoop under it, yet ſuch a glory there is in the Truth, ſuch a luſtre and ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as will manifeſt it ſelf: and therefore the promiſe is, <hi>The Righteous ſhal ſhine as the Sun in the firmament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:169498:14"/>4. The fourth great and precious Promiſe is to be Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of <hi>Vertue:</hi> Now Vertue is either taken for a quick and lively freſh power in any thing; as when we ſay, ſuch an herb is full of vertue to ſmell on, or ſuch meat is full of vertue to taſte on: or elſe Vertue is ſome ſecret hidden power, which can neither be ſmelt nor taſted, but yet is perceived. As in the Loadſtone there is a hidden vertue to draw Iron, &amp;c. So there is a lively Vertuous Power in the Word of Life, it will take ſome effect or other, and not return in vain; for either it meets with <hi>its own kind</hi> in us, and that <hi>reliſhes</hi> and <hi>taſtes,</hi> and finds a ſweetneſs in it; as <hi>David</hi> ſays, <hi>Thy Word is ſweeter unto me then the honey and the honey-comb;</hi> It is a ſweet ſmelling ſavour to that, <hi>a ſavour of life unto life;</hi> but if it meet with the enemy, that <hi>evil principle in us,</hi> that curſes, and rages, and rends, and teers the child at the ſight of Jeſus, it is <hi>a ſavour of death unto death</hi> to That. Who ever they are that neither taſte a ſweetneſs in Truth, nor ſmell a ſavour of reſt from it; yet there is a <hi>ſecret vertue</hi> that <hi>will cut them to the heart. Nabal</hi>'s heart dyes and faints in him, do what he can; It ſtrikes a ſecret blow, and gets in between the joynts of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: There is a <hi>living vertue</hi> in it, and like a potion of Phyſick it will work one way or other, either make better or worſe. And thus the firſt thing is opened to you, What are theſe great and precious Promiſes? And before I come to the next thing, to open what it is to partake of the Divine Nature, I would have this I have ſaid well looked over by you: For who of you is yet fit to be marryed to Chriſt? He will not take another mans wife: whileſt we have a husband living, any <hi>created thing,</hi> in whoſe <hi>boſom we lie, and take delight and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> ſo long we are not a wife for Chriſt; and if our hearts be pulled off by force only, and the way hedged
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:169498:14"/>
up, that we cannot find our Lovers, this is not that which pleaſeth him neither; He will not marry a divorced wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but only a chaſte Virgin, a Heart that ſtands looſe and clean from all corruptible things, ſuch a heart only is a fit Spouſe for Chriſt, to be Partaker of this divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It concerns ſome of you to enquire what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>it is you ſeek, <hi>Life</hi> or <hi>Death:</hi> None of you, I know, will ſay Death; you would all have Life. But what then mean the <hi>bleatings?</hi> the cryings and huntings after pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Things, where Death is in the pot? Why are you living in the creatures, in your own wills and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels? Why are you not at a ſtrait to cry out to be ſaved, if Life be the Thing you ſeek? There are many Seekers in the World; the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſeek after wiſdom, and the <hi>Jews</hi> they ſeek a ſign: ſome ſeek <hi>eaſe,</hi> and <hi>quiet,</hi> and <hi>reſt</hi> from their torment; ſome ſeek <hi>wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>knowledg,</hi> and <hi>parts,</hi> to be great and honoured; but <hi>Death is in all this.</hi> See then what would you have? Is Life the thing you ſeek for? or have you it already? If you are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of Life indeed, then the reſt will follow: <hi>Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> will then come in, a God-like mind, to be <hi>juſt, ſingle, merciful, h ly,</hi> like to the Pattern; and then <hi>Glory</hi> will follow, your good works will ſhine before men, and then a vertue will go forth which may be ſavored and reliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all your words and actions. But now do theſe things appear in us? what is it we ſeek? what would we have? is Life the Thing? would we have Chriſt to dwell in us? No, we would not all come ſo near; we would have Chriſt a great way off, at the right hand of God, to ſave us at the laſt gaſp, when we come to dye, but not live the life of the Righteous: But be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, it is in vain to come hither, if we ſeek not Life. But then,</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:169498:15"/>2. Suppoſe a ſtreſs be upon you, that indeed you would reach out to the Tree of Life, becauſe you are ſmit to the ground, and cannot eſcape the hand, but it will bring you to Death do what you can: But now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire upon what grounds wouldſt thou have Life? upon what account? why doſt thou hope or expect it? is <hi>it promiſed to thee?</hi> is the <hi>word gone forth from Christ,</hi> that He will raiſe thee up at the laſt day? what ground have you to hope more then all the world? though you may <hi>ſeek it,</hi> yet that will <hi>not do</hi> it neither. <hi>Eſau</hi> ſought the bleſſing with tears: And (Chriſt ſaith) <hi>Many ſhall ſeek to enter, and ſhall not be able:</hi> And (<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) That <hi>Iſrael obtained not what they ſought after, but the Election obtained it.</hi> There is a People which ſhall ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be Partakers of Life, to whom the Promiſe is made, but no other: The Promiſe is ſure to all the Seed; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſee, how ſtandeſt thou in all thy ſeeking and hoping for Life? Hadſt thou ever a Promiſe of Life given thee, either to thy ſelf, <hi>witneſſed to thy own Soul,</hi> or given <hi>to any of his People for thee,</hi> that <hi>Thou ſhalt Live? &amp;c.</hi> For a vain thing it is, to go and take Promiſes up out of the Scripture, and make them our own: <hi>Promiſes made to Abraham,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>the reſt,</hi> what are theſe to thee? <hi>unleſs God make them</hi> over, and give them <hi>to thee,</hi> as He did <hi>to them.</hi> And then,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Enquire what would you have Life for? would you <hi>have it to pleaſe your ſelves?</hi> to live to your wills? to be at eaſe, and be freed from troubles? Alas, this is not a right ſeeking of it! As <hi>Jehu</hi> anſwered the Kings meſſenger concerning Peace, <hi>What haſt thou to do with Peace?</hi> So, what haſt thou to do with Life? it belongs not to thee, unleſs there be that end in it, to live for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſervice, and not thy own: Therefore it is of great concernment to know what we are about. I wonder
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:169498:15"/>
ſometimes on what uncertain bottoms you ſtand; <hi>you know not</hi> whither you go, nor <hi>what you would have in all your hearings;</hi> but like the picture of a rampant Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the wall, come ſeven years hence, and that is ſtill in the ſame place: So I have known ſome of you theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years, to be Seekers, and Profeſſors, and Talkers, but you are ſtill where you were ſeven years ago, as <hi>carnal, ſenſual,</hi> as <hi>blind</hi> &amp; <hi>ignorant</hi> in the ways of God, as much glued to the world, and ſeeking your ſelves, not removed a ſtep nearer God then you were, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But then,</p>
                  <p>For ſome of you, whom <hi>indeed I know,</hi> and who yet lie dead in your graves, faſt bound in chains and fetters, under darkneſs, and fears, and ſorrows, and are no ways able ever to get out; to you this promiſe of Life is made, That God will make the dry bones live, and raiſe you out of your graves. It concerns you to look after it; For he hath promiſed, and will perform; He will ſurely keep his Word unto <hi>Jacob,</hi> and his Covenant to <hi>Iſrael.</hi> God will ſay to all that keep us down in chains and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, <hi>Let my People go, that they may ſerve me;</hi> Let my <hi>Captives go free.</hi> The time will come, when he will turn our mourning into joy, and fill our tongues with laughter, and our mouths with praiſes, when he ſhall bring back the Captivity of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when the Time of Life is come.</p>
                  <p>And now it followeth to go on, <hi>That you might be made Partakers of the Divine Nature:</hi> All this I have ſpoken of, is to paſs upon the Soul before there can be this partaking of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> to be joyned in, and married to it: There may be ſomewhat of Life, and Godlineſs, and Glory, and Vertue ſpringing in the Soul, but yet it may be but one alone, as a chaſte Virgin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>ſingle and looſe from all,</hi> and fit for a Husband, but
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:169498:16"/>
not <hi>yet married;</hi> the Houſe muſt be thus ſwept, and provided, and made fit, but yet the King is to come to lodg in it; It is yet a farther thing to become fruitful, and have children in the Truth; therefore the next thing to enquire into, is,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, What is it to partake of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Holy Ghoſt is this Divine Nature</hi> ſpoke of: Now Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He will give the Holy Spirit to them that ask it;</hi> only to ſuch as ask it, ſuch as are at a ſtrait to cry for it, and only living men can cry and ask, and to them he will give this Holy Spirit: God communicates and gives in to the Soul <hi>a Holy Seed, of his own Nature and Being,</hi> as really as in the outward generation of a man. A ſeed muſt firſt be given and received, before ever a child can be brought forth: So is it with the Soul, a ſeed of God muſt be really planted in, and ſown there, ſomewhat of his own Being and Subſtance left behind in the Soul, to ſtay &amp; abide, and grow and ſpread, or elſe there can never be fruitfulneſs expected. If God only come and go as a <hi>wayfaring man,</hi> and take not up his <hi>abode,</hi> ſo long we ſhall never be ſetled down to any thing truly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable, but up and down, as His coming or going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way is. As the <hi>Spirit came on Saul,</hi> and <hi>came on Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam,</hi> ſo long they propheſied, and ſpake of God, and were as it were new men; but the Spirit departs again, and then they are as other men, the ſame they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But now to have <hi>God dwell in man,</hi> to take up his abode, This is my Reſt, here will I dwell for ever, this is a mighty thing indeed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To be made Partakers of the Divine Nature, as it implies an abiding and ſetled planting in of a ſeed of God, ſo it is ſecondly a <hi>known</hi> and <hi>felt-thing in the Soul;</hi> there is a certain <hi>cloſe</hi> and <hi>meet of the man;</hi> He receives
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:169498:16"/>
the ſeed in; the man is brought to hear, and feel, and know that God is nigh.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> where it is thus given in by God, and received by the man, it <hi>brings forth of its own kind and Image:</hi> He gives to every ſeed its own body. <hi>Adam</hi> begets a ſon in his own likeneſs, natural, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and earthly, and ſelfiſh, having his centre wholly downwards: And ſo the Lord, He <hi>begets Children like Himſelf,</hi> in Patience, Love, Singleneſs, Juſtice, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, &amp;c. Where this <hi>Divine Nature</hi> is ſown, it will ſurely grow up into the <hi>likeneſs of its Father,</hi> it will <hi>own its Father in its countenance,</hi> it will turn the man into the ſame mind, and will, and deſires; and if not ſo, yet do the man what he can, whether he will or not, this Truth wil act &amp; ſtir, and bring forth like it ſelf: and in this it will <hi>deal plainly and truly,</hi> and <hi>ſhew the man where he is;</hi> it will not be bribed to <hi>dawb</hi> with <hi>untempered mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> and yet is merciful too, tender-hearted, eaſie to be entreated, full of all good fruits, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now then,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This may be of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> to enquire, what it is we would come to? would we <hi>receive this Divine Nature,</hi> and joyn in and be marryed to it? It is certain you can never have children, nor be fruitful in the Truth, unleſs you are marryed in here: Though you ſhould be <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,</hi> and be brought to ſtand clear and <hi>looſe</hi> from <hi>all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanglements,</hi> yet you can never have <hi>children,</hi> to <hi>keep your name alive in Iſrael;</hi> you will <hi>live and dye alone,</hi> without you are brought to joyn into this <hi>Spirit of Chriſt:</hi> Though we may have Fathers and Inſtructers to care and provide for us, yet that Promiſe cannot take place, <hi>In ſtead of fathers thou ſhalt have childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whom thou mayſt make Princes in all Lands.</hi> We can never leave a ſeed after us, that may grow up to be <hi>Princes in the Truth,</hi> to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:169498:17"/>
make it ſpread in the world, and run, and be glorious: but at preſent we are far from this; there is a very <hi>ill ſpirit in us,</hi> not willing to ſee another <hi>thrive</hi> and <hi>prosper in the Truth:</hi> We would neither enter in our ſelves, nor ſuffer them that would. How few of us are yet reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out to this Thing, to long for and deſire to be <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Divine Nature?</hi> We would rather <hi>ſtarve, and live on any Husks,</hi> any <hi>ſhifts</hi> and <hi>ſharkings,</hi> then come <hi>near God for a Feaſt;</hi> our hearts chooſe rather a <hi>Dogs life, hunger and eaſe.</hi> Hungry indeed we are many times, at a want for ſomewhat; but if we can get but a <hi>little eaſe</hi> in our want, we can <hi>bear it,</hi> and ſo the ſtrait gets off; and this may diſcover that <hi>great ill will</hi> that is in us to the thriving and proſpering of the Truth, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This may <hi>inform you what the End of all is;</hi> all the Promiſes of <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> and <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> they all tend to this end, That <hi>you might be Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Divine Nature:</hi> The Door is yet open, the Promiſe and Call is yet after you; It belongs to you, as it did to <hi>Ruths</hi> kinſman to marry <hi>Ruth,</hi> and purchaſe the Inheritance: but if you ſhall ſlight it, and ſay as he did, <hi>I cannot redeem it, for it will ſpoil my own Inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;</hi> if we ſhall anſwer ſo, No, we cannot <hi>come ſo near,</hi> to <hi>partake of the Divine Nature,</hi> to <hi>dwell with God,</hi> He will be a <hi>conſuming fire,</hi> He will <hi>croſs</hi> and ſpoyl all our <hi>wills,</hi> and <hi>delights,</hi> and <hi>deſigns:</hi> If we ſhall thus judg our ſelves unworthy of eternal Life, then <hi>Lo He turns to the Gentiles:</hi> He will turn to another people; for ſure He will find out ſome that will be glad to receive Him, whoſe Souls will be at a ſtrait, and <hi>thirſt after the living God.</hi> But as yet the Door is open to you; what is the reaſon you are no more upon it? They are exceeding great and <hi>precious Promiſes in themſelves,</hi> why are they not <hi>precious to us?</hi> Sure they would, had we but a Heart.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:169498:17"/>
Therefore conſider of it, it is offered to you; and if you ſhall follow on to know the Lord, you ſhall ſurely know Him. Conſider, the Door is open, the precious Promiſes are given to you, of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> &amp;c. Why then are you <hi>paſſing away your days</hi> on ſuch <hi>low, trivial, and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things? Joſephs</hi> bleſſing was large, reached out to the utmoſt bounds of the <hi>Everlaſting Hills;</hi> and why are we ſo <hi>ſcant-hearted</hi> and <hi>low</hi> in our deſires? Why are we not upon theſe <hi>great and precious Things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed?</hi> and to partake of <hi>this Divine Nature,</hi> and thence be fruitful in the Truth, and bring forth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that may ſtand and live for <hi>ever</hi> after us!</p>

that they <hi>committed whoredom,</hi> and <hi>will not frame their doings to ſeek unto their God,</hi> Verſ. 3, 4. And this is that miſery that befalls ſuch as tranſgreſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord, that received not the <hi>Truth</hi> in the <hi>love</hi> of it, that obeyed not <hi>counſel;</hi> the Hand of the Lord will ſurely meet with ſuch; He will teer and wound them: <hi>There ſhall be no peace to the wicked.</hi> When <hi>Iſrael was a child, then I loved Him,</hi> ſaith God; then He was tender, and ſoft, and pliable to be ordered: but <hi>as They called them, ſo They went from them, Hoſea</hi> 11.2. As the Prophets called them indeed to come up, and come nigh God, then there is a going backward from Him; <hi>He is bent to a back-ſliding heart:</hi> But <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſhall be ſure to be dealt with and made deſolate: A Time comes wherein God will meet with Him. <hi>The Pride of</hi> Iſrael <hi>teſtifies to his face; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall</hi> Iſrael <hi>and</hi> Ephraim <hi>fall in their iniquity:</hi> v. 5.

And when thus it ſhall be in the midſt of the Land, when this is the Souls condition, to be <hi>rent</hi> and <hi>torn</hi> by God, and then left and forſaken, that He cannot be found, but He hides Himſelf; though <hi>Job</hi> go forward and backward, to the right hand and to the left, yet He is gone and cannot be found. <hi>He feeds among the lillies</hi> (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

How do <hi>Iſaiah, Jeremiah, Samuel, Hoſea,</hi> and ſo all the Prophets, ſtand in the gap for their people, and call upon them in their deſolation <hi>to come in and return to the Lord!</hi> But whom do they call to return? not all men, not ſuch as never was <hi>nigh to the Lord;</hi> No: Onely <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> his own people, that have been once nigh, and are backſlidden, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Prodigals</hi> from their <hi>fathers houſe:</hi> Onely to ſuch is the Call; and in the worſt time of all, when torn, and wounded, and left of God: (yet, ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,) <hi>Come, and let us return to the Lord; for He hath torn, and He will heal, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this <hi>Return</hi> theſe things are conſiderable.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They that <hi>return</hi> know ſurely that They are out of the way: the Soul muſt firſt be made truly knowing and ſenſible of that, when it is met with in its gaddings, as <hi>Hagar</hi> was by the Angel, and examined ſtrictly; <hi>Whence comeſt Thou</hi> Hagar? <hi>and whither wilt Thou go? Thou art quite out of the way in flying from thy Miſtreſs</hi> Sarah: <hi>Return, and ſubmit unto her.</hi> The going out is thus clearly opened and layd upon the Soul.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:169498:20"/>But wherein were They gone out of the way, that</p>
                  <p>They are called on to <hi>return?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. They were out of the way, in that they <hi>broke priſon,</hi> and ran away from the ſtrait; as Chap. 5.10. <hi>The Princes of Judah were like them that remove the Bound:</hi> A Bound was ſet to keep them in a narrower compaſs, that God might the better come nigh to deal with them: as it is in <hi>Job; If They be bound in fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and holden in the cords of affliction; then He ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth man his ſin, and his tranſgreſſion, how he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded:</hi> Then is a time when God can come neer to ſearch and dreſs the ſore, when the Soul is layd faſt from running away; when it is held in the <hi>Bond of the ſpirit,</hi> then the heart is opened, the wickedneſs diſcovered, what a wretched caſe man is in, hopeleſs and helpleſs. And this is the way God takes to hide <hi>pride</hi> from mans eyes, and lay him low in the duſt. And how have we gone out of the way in this? We have removed the <hi>Bond,</hi> and run away, and would not endure the ſtrait, nor ſtick to our conditions, to lie ſo low, and wretched, and helpleſs: We have flown out from this, and ſaid as They, <hi>No, but we are Lords, and will come no more at him.</hi> Here have we turned out; and if ever we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, we muſt come in ſenſibly guilty under this, of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the Bound,</hi> and running away from our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, living at our hands and own counſels at a diſtance from God. And now here it is needful for all of you to enquire, how it ſtands with you? Have you all turned out here in <hi>removing the Bound?</hi> or were you yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in it? I know ſome of you were never as yet in this <hi>Bond of the Spirit,</hi> but have been left to your own wills, and runnings of heart, and never yet were brought to this narrow compaſs. But ſome of you, I know, have <hi>removed this Bound,</hi> have got from your ſin, and guilt,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:169498:21"/>
and miſery, when opened to you: You have turned your eyes away from your own ſore, and looked aſquint on anothers faults, and pryed into their miſcarriages; have ſpyed out the mote there, but would not ſee the beam in our own eye, but have covered that cloſe, and hid it: and therfore is the ſtroke now come upon us. God hath found us out, though man could not; and there is a ſecret moth hath eaten and conſumed us, and ſpoyled all our good, becauſe we have run away, and would not endure the <hi>bond</hi> to be put upon us. I know aſſuredly the time when God would have brought ſome of you to a ſtrait, that nothing ſhould have contented you without the <hi>knowledg</hi> of the <hi>Love of God;</hi> what the <hi>eternal thoughts</hi> are concerning you, and what ſhould become of us in the latter end, that we might not live on <hi>noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> or <hi>words,</hi> or <hi>knowledg,</hi> or <hi>operations,</hi> nor any thing ſhort of this: but here have we broke away, and would not endure to come at it. But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They were out of the way in going about to <hi>cure themſelves</hi> before the day came, the time of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance: Chap. 5.13. <hi>When</hi> Ephraim <hi>ſaw his ſickneſs, and</hi> Judah <hi>his wound, then went</hi> Ephraim <hi>to the Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, and ſent to King</hi> Jareb; <hi>yet He could not heal you:</hi> ſuch a reaching hath there been after <hi>eaſe</hi> and <hi>cure</hi> and <hi>deliverance</hi> before the time was come; <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>I will be as a moth and rottenneſs to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim:</hi> a ſecret hand hath followed us, as <hi>David</hi> ſays; <hi>I am conſumed by the blow of thy hand:</hi> a ſecret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and mouldring away, and coming to nothing; and of all deaths this is moſt miſerable, to dye ſo by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, fall in pieces, and melt away to nothing like a ſnail: and thus hath the Lord dealt with us, ſuch a <hi>waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>decaying</hi> hath been upon us, but yet the thing is not layd heart: None ſpeaks aright, nor ſays, <hi>What
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:169498:21"/>
have I done? what is the cauſe of this deſolation? Why is the hand againſt me? How hath a ſecret moth eaten up all our good?</hi> Time was there was a tender conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, an awe of ſpirit, and fear to offend, a watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs over all our ways, and thoughts, and words; but now all is gone: <hi>The Lord hath ſmitten us,</hi> and <hi>our flower fadeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now if this were indeed but ſenſibly upon us, it would make us look home, and not have our eyes in every corner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to pry into one anothers failings; but it would be work enough to look on our own guilt, to ſee how we have broke the bonds, and got away from owning our ſhame, and lying under our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and have not ſtayd till we were waſhed from our blood, but have waſhed our ſelves, and forced our ſelves (as <hi>Saul</hi> did) <hi>to offer ſacrifice,</hi> when we heard but a report of deliverance: <hi>Behold, this is the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the World:</hi> Yea preſently we reckoned all this <hi>our own,</hi> and clambered up to get into the <hi>liberty,</hi> before we were <hi>called for</hi> our of <hi>our priſons;</hi> and we muſt therefore down again to our bonds: we were but an <hi>untimely birth,</hi> and muſt not live to ſee the Sun. We tarryed not in our graves till that word came from Chriſt, <hi>Damoſel, Ariſe; Lazarus, Come forth;</hi> but we broke away by force, as a Servant runs from his Maſter; and that ſhews we broke from him, in that there is no heart to return: we never cared for the Lord, nor loved him ſince, but as we have been forced to Him for a little eaſe; and when we have got that, we have been gone preſently, and cared for no more.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The ſecond Thing conſiderable in this <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,</hi> is from the Call and Counſel of the Prophet, <hi>Come, and let us return,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Being once out, we cannot return
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:169498:22"/>
of our ſelves without counſel:</hi> The Soul knows not what to do, nor which way to turn, being once loſt, it is in ſuch an amaze; ſo fooliſh a thing is man: and therefore if we are never brought to that ſtrait, to cry out for ſome to counſel, and lead, and tell us what to do, <hi>Men and Brethren, what ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi> without this there will be no returning.</p>
                  <p>For out we are got, that is certain, and have miſerably loſt our ſelves: For ſome of us were formerly truly touched and viſited, and taken out of the world, were made to ſee and underſtand the vanity of our former ways, and in what a miſerable and dangerous eſtate we lay, if the Lord ſtept not in to help us out; and whether this would ever be or not, we knew not; and here we were made to own, and bow, and lie under our conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as undone Perſons, if Mercy help'd not out: Thus we lay low for a time under this bond; but ſoon as ever we heard a report of Deliverance, and were pointed out to it, as <hi>John</hi> pointed to Chriſt, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God,</hi> &amp;c. Here is one that can cure you, and bring you out, This is the Saviour of the World; when a Light came to ſhew us this, we preſently reached at it, and called all our own, and would not lie in our miſery till he called us to come, till the Lord Himſelf delivered us; but thought now that we ſaw the <hi>medicine</hi> lie before us, we were wiſe enough to take it, and to cure our ſelves; we thought we could now live of our ſelves, without being beholding to God; that our <hi>Light and Inſtruction into the Truth,</hi> that <hi>the ſight of Salvation had been enough:</hi> And here we went out like <hi>Prodigals,</hi> till all was ſpent, and Poverty came upon us as an <hi>armed man:</hi> We got out, and promiſed our ſelves liberty and eaſe, (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of ſome,) <hi>who promiſing liberty, Themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the ſervants of corruption.</hi> We were the farther
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:169498:22"/>
off, and the more entangled; that which <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>If I waſh my ſelf</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>mine own clothes ſhal defile me:</hi> We <hi>have indeed waſhed and waſhed our ſelves, but that will not do;</hi> we put on our own clothes again, and we are preſently all dirt, as bad as ever: Here hath been our going out, and now we are out, we would never ſtir home again. But the Call and Counſel is to us, <hi>Come, and let us return;</hi> That Charge is layd againſt us, <hi>Thou haſt forſaken thy firſt Love; remember whence thou art fallen, and repent.</hi> This I ſpeak is a Deep Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, if the Soul be not led in, to read the meaning: The Hypocrite he cannot know it; he will ever be hoping and clambering up ſome way or other to get life, and never endure theſe bonds, though he periſh for ever; and how many are thus utterly loſt! And the Sons of God They cannot know this neither, until it coſt them dear, till a dart ſtrike through their Liver: They will taſte of the <hi>Whores dainties,</hi> of her <hi>ſweet morſels,</hi> till they are made to vomit all up again, and loſe the ſweet words. We have <hi>taken up words of Scripture, and Hopes, and Promiſes to our ſelves,</hi> but <hi>who gave us them?</hi> The Door was open, and we thought we might venture in, and take what we pleaſed. But the Spouſe could give a better account; <hi>He brought me into the banqueting houſe,</hi> &amp;c. Did He thus take us by the hand, and bring us in? No, no, we thruſt in without the wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; we ſtayd not till the Angel was ſent to roul away the ſtone from the mouth of the Sepulchre, till Chriſt Himſelf came to looſen the Priſon doors, and let the <hi>Captives go free.</hi> And now to all you that have thus turned out, and therefore have had a blaſt, a mildew, a ſecret moth conſuming and deſtroying all your green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and livelineſs, and freſhneſs in the Truth, (for how dead and ſapleſs do you now lie!) to you yet is this
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:169498:23"/>
Counſel given, and the Call made, <hi>Come, and let us return to the Lord, for he hath ſmitten,</hi> &amp;c. Lie under the hand, and turn to him that ſmites you. And that is,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The third Thing conſiderable in this <hi>Return,</hi> It is <hi>to the Lord,</hi> who hath <hi>wounded,</hi> that he may <hi>heal. Many they are wounded indeed, but they can heal them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;</hi> run to the <hi>Promiſes,</hi> and <hi>warineſs,</hi> and <hi>reſolvings,</hi> and they are preſently whole: But when the Lord wounds indeed with the wound of a cruel one, when he rends, and teers, and goes away, then ſhall no <hi>healing medicine</hi> be found out; when God comes to a ſtrict enquiry once, and <hi>ſearches Jeruſalem with candles,</hi> looks into every dark corner, and asks for an account of the bottom of the matter; <hi>if we know what ſhall become of us for ever,</hi> how our <hi>everlaſting Condition hangs,</hi> whether all we have, all the ſtrong <hi>reaſons,</hi> and <hi>hopes,</hi> and <hi>concluſions</hi> from the <hi>operations,</hi> and <hi>enlargements,</hi> and <hi>powers of Truth,</hi> will all theſe <hi>prove our condition good for ever?</hi> Was not <hi>Saul</hi> alſo among the Prophets? and was not the Spirit of God upon <hi>Balaam?</hi> and yet both fell ſhort. I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſometimes how we can paſs it over from day to day, and not conſider what the end ſhall be; but it is becauſe the wound is not deep, we have no ſenſe to feel, but are like a poſt in the wall: but when He ſhall wound home indeed, and ſtrike the blow to the heart, then it will ſeize; it ſhall not be ſo eaſie getting from it; then, if ever we be cured, the ſame hand muſt do it that ſtruck the Blow, all other Phyſicians will be of no value: but, <hi>Come, let us return to the Lord, for he hath torn, and he will heal,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And He will heal us.</hi> Now,</p>
                  <p>What Ways doth the Lord take to Cure this Wound?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt Way to cure a Wound throughly, is by
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:169498:23"/>
                     <hi>removing the ill humor that feeds and maintains the ſore,</hi> elſe all <hi>plaiſters</hi> and <hi>ſalves</hi> applyed to <hi>heal</hi> are in vain, and to no purpoſe. So God deals with the Soul; He goes firſt to the Root, to ſtench the corrupt humor, the <hi>bitter Fountain</hi> that feeds and ſupplies all the ſtreams; <hi>Senſſe</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> they have been the ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor which have fed the ſore all along, whileſt we could wring, and wreſtle, and murmur, and complain againſt God, ſaying, <hi>Why hath he made me thus? Why hath he brought us into this Wilderneſs to deſtroy us? Who hath reſiſted his Will?</hi> Whileſt theſe <hi>pleadings</hi> and <hi>reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings live,</hi> 'tis impoſſible our <hi>conditions</hi> ſhould be mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; theſe will feſter and corrupt, uſe what means we will for healing; therefore God promiſeth, <hi>I will heal their back-ſlidings;</hi> that way He takes when he intends a Cure. Whileſt we go about to cure our ſelves, and flee upon Horſes, becauſe they are ſwift, ſo long the caſe grows worſe with us, the wound encreaſeth; but <hi>ſtand ſtill, and ſee the Salvation of God,</hi> ſaith <hi>Moſes:</hi> Let him alone, and He will never leave, till he hath met with the bitter Root that ſpoyls all our proſpering.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another way of healing a wound, is by <hi>taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> or <hi>aſſwaging</hi> the <hi>extremity</hi> of the <hi>anguiſh</hi> and <hi>ſmart</hi> of the <hi>ſore,</hi> elſe the violence of the pain will let no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing take place: So is it with the Soul, ſometimes there is ſuch an extremity of anguiſh that perplexes and torments it, that nothing of hope or encouragement can come near it: When it is made to look over all its <hi>rebellions,</hi> and <hi>ſtandings out,</hi> and <hi>provocations,</hi> what it hath done, how it hath grieved the Holy Spirit, and refuſed mercy, and brought all this that it now lies under on its own head; You may thank your ſelf for this, ſaith the Accuſer, this is your own will, and way, and choyce; and this cauſes a felt anguiſh and torture in the Soul, when all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:169498:24"/>
come up of ſins done ſeven years ſince, as if but newly acted: How Thou provokedſt God, and broke priſon at ſuch a time, and ſlightedſt and turnedſt back: This eats, and corrodes, and frets the Soul, and gives it no reſt, to hear, or hope, or beleeve any thing from God. And therefore this is the next Thing God doth in going to cure; He removes all the <hi>guilt,</hi> and <hi>ſin,</hi> and <hi>ſhame,</hi> and <hi>unbelief,</hi> that lay upon the <hi>Soul,</hi> and lays all upon the <hi>ſcape-goat,</hi> to be carryed into the <hi>land of forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs;</hi> that though the iniquity of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> be ſought for, yet it cannot be found: <hi>I will remember their ſin no more</hi> (ſaith God;) and this pacifies and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwages the pain, and calms the Soul: He makes the <hi>ſtorm</hi> a <hi>calm,</hi> and ſo brings them to their <hi>deſired ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another way God takes in healing, is, by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a plaiſter of <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>loving-kindneſs:</hi> Then He ſpeaks kindly and friendly to the Soul, comes with words of <hi>peace;</hi> he comes enquiring, <hi>Is there no balm in Gilead? is there no Phyſician there? Is not the Lord in Zion? is not her King in her?</hi> The Lord opens to the Soul a ſoveraign Balm that can heal all ſores: He diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers his Son the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> that <hi>ſeed of Truth</hi> that lies within; <hi>This is my well-beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> Now He comes gently to the Soul, and moves and ſtirs in it; not altogether to deſpair and cut off it ſelf from hope; but an enquiry is made in the Soul, <hi>Is not the Lord in Zion? Is there not hope in Iſrael concerning this thing?</hi> However deſperate the caſe ſeems, yet <hi>hope</hi> gets up; <hi>Who can tell but he may be gracious?</hi> It is one thing to have <hi>Truth</hi> manifeſted to be within the Soul, and another thing to have the uſe and enjoyment of it; one thing to have a healing plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter applyed, and another thing to be healed: <hi>In the

third day He will raiſe us up, and we ſhall live in his ſight:</hi> To be <hi>raiſed</hi> out of this pit of <hi>mire and clay,</hi> out of this <hi>dark dungeon,</hi> to <hi>live in his ſight;</hi> to be brought out of <hi>darkneſs</hi> into <hi>his marvelous light,</hi> this is wonderful! And <hi>how beautiful are the feet of them that bring glad tydings of peace!</hi> Theſe <hi>good tydings</hi> are a ſweet <hi>reviving plaiſter</hi> to the <hi>dying Soul.</hi> When juſt now at the <hi>brink</hi> of the <hi>Pit;</hi> and the <hi>Life</hi> draws nigh to the grave; then for an <hi>Interpreter</hi> to come, <hi>one of a thouſand,</hi> to ſhew to Man his <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> to open that <hi>ſeed</hi> and <hi>principle</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> that is within, and ſo ſave his life from going down to the pit; Is not ſuch a Balm as this able to cure all wounds? how doth this calm and quiet the Soul, and beget admirings! O who would ever think any good ſhould grow here! that <hi>Truth</hi> ſhould lie hid in ſuch a filthy, defiled and pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted heart! as <hi>Jacob</hi> breaks forth, <hi>God was in this place, and I knew it not:</hi> and <hi>Hagar, I did not think to have met with the Lord here:</hi> What! when all <hi>hope</hi> of <hi>life</hi> is gone, yet then to have <hi>ſalvation</hi> and <hi>deliverance</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened; <hi>out of the Eater</hi> to have <hi>meat;</hi> in the midſt of all <hi>guilt</hi> and <hi>ſhame</hi> and <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>luſts</hi> that oppreſs and torment, yet to have this opened, That ſuch a <hi>Soul</hi> as this is no leſs then the <hi>gate of Heaven,</hi> where <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> are to paſs in and out; This is a <hi>pleaſant plaiſter</hi> indeed: This heals the <hi>dying inwards,</hi> when it is given in by God, not taken up by <hi>mans gatherings,</hi> and <hi>concluſions,</hi> and <hi>hopings,</hi> as all the <hi>healings</hi> before were.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Lord <hi>heals this ſore</hi> by ſetting <hi>a time,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing <hi>a day</hi> for <hi>deliverance,</hi> and putting the <hi>Soul</hi> in a poſture of waiting till that come: ſo the <hi>Angel</hi> opens to <hi>Daniel, Seventy weeks are determined, to finiſh tranſgreſſion, and to bring in everlaſting Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>

And ſo in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> pleads with <hi>God,</hi> that <hi>It is time to have mercy upon Zion, yea the ſet time is come:</hi> But what is this <hi>ſet time</hi> for <hi>Zion</hi> to be built? Why, it follows, For <hi>it pities thy ſervants to ſee her ſtones lie ſcattered in the duſt.</hi> This is the <hi>ſet time,</hi> when the <hi>hearts</hi> of any are raiſed to pity and take to heart the <hi>deſolation</hi> and <hi>ruines</hi> of <hi>Zion:</hi> and when the <hi>Soul</hi> is pitched upon this, to lie in the duſt, loſt and ſcattered, and undone as it is, till the heart of ſome or other be raiſed to pity it. It is impoſſible you ſhould ever be brought forth as <hi>children of the Truth,</hi> unleſs the Heart of ſome be turned towards you to be a <hi>Father;</hi> as the Text ſaith of <hi>Elias, He ſhall turn the hearts of Fathers to Children, and Children to their Fathers.</hi> The Soul is layd down here, it cannot get up it ſelf, but muſt lie wounded and half dead, till ſome good <hi>Samaritan</hi> paſs by and take it up; and this is <hi>the greateſt tryal</hi> and <hi>hardeſt thing</hi> to bear, that ever could come to <hi>mans heart,</hi> That He muſt lie thus <hi>buckled and ſubmitted to another, till his Brother come to pity and take him up:</hi> And now if the heart ſcorns, and will not come in here to be thus beholding to another, it may lie long enough, and not yet <hi>the time of healing is come: If thou ſcorneſt, thou alone ſhalt bear it:</hi> if thou ſcorn this thing, to lie as thou art till the heart of ſome <hi>father</hi> be turned to thee, thou mayſt go long enough without <hi>cure:</hi> But the Soul that God hath indeed pitched upon this, as the way for its <hi>cure,</hi> that, is ever looking when ſome ſhall <hi>turn in to pity it,</hi> and ask <hi>how it doth,</hi> and take it out of the dirt where it ſticks faſt; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ever crying out, <hi>Is it nothing to you, all ye that paſs by? Is there none that mindes my ſorrows? Was ever grief like mine? And is there none to pity and lay my caſe to heart, and travel, and pray, and cry
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:169498:25"/>
for me!</hi> Such a breaking out is there, not murmuringly nor commandingly, but bewailing and crying out, out of the ſenſe of miſery, and longing for cure; <hi>O that there were ſome to pity!</hi> Nothing elſe can content, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is pitched upon that as the way for its <hi>cure;</hi> all other <hi>plaiſters</hi> cannot reach the <hi>ſore:</hi> and therefore it cries for ſome to help it, as the <hi>blinde man</hi> cryed after Chriſt; <hi>Thou Son of David, have mercy on me:</hi> and no rebukes from others, to hold his peace and be ſtill, can prevail with him, but ſtill the <hi>cry</hi> goes on, till the <hi>cure</hi> is done.</p>
                  <p>But it followeth:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>After two days He will raiſe us up, and we ſhall live, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond days work now follows, the day of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving;</hi> no man ſhall ſeek the Lord in vain. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet here invites &amp; calls to <hi>come and return:</hi> and if any ſhall be prevailed with, they ſhall not loſe their labor in the Lord: <hi>Verily there is a reward for the Righteous: Mark the upright man, and conſider the perfect; for the end of that man is peace.</hi> After two days <hi>He will revive</hi> ſuch as return, and <hi>in the third day He will raiſe them up;</hi> and this is a <hi>ſtrange cure</hi> indeed, for ſuch a <hi>wound</hi> to be ſo ſoon cured, <hi>in two days!</hi> This is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful; when, as <hi>David</hi> cries out, <hi>My wounds ſtink, and are corrupt;</hi> when, with <hi>onah,</hi> the Soul lies in the bottom of <hi>Hell,</hi> and cries out, <hi>The Earth with her bars is about me for ever;</hi> when all <hi>hope</hi> of <hi>life</hi> is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and the <hi>Soul</hi> concludes, <hi>My wound is incurable;</hi> yet within <hi>two days</hi> a <hi>cure</hi> is wrought, the caſe is alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the <hi>man poſſeſſed with a Devil</hi> now ſits at <hi>the feet of Jeſus,</hi> ſober and clothed. Here is a <hi>Phyſician</hi> of value indeed; That when <hi>Peter</hi> ſleeps faſt bound be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Souldiers, and the next day 'tis concluded
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:169498:26"/>
He ſhould be brought forth to be executed; then in a nick of time an <hi>Angel</hi> is ſent, the <hi>chains</hi> fall off, and the <hi>iron gates</hi> open of their own accord, and <hi>Peter</hi> is delivered; <hi>At midngiht a cry was heard, The Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom cometh.</hi> In a moment, in a time unthought of, the ſtream is turned: Though <hi>grief endure for a night, yet joy cometh in the morning:</hi> 'tis ſoon done, but a word with Chriſt; <hi>Peace, be ſtill,</hi> and a great calm is wrought: <hi>Speak but the word</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Centurion) and my ſervant ſhall be healed. After two days He will revive us.</hi> But,</p>
                  <p>How doth <hi>He revive?</hi> what way takes He to it?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He takes off all the <hi>bonds</hi> and <hi>chains</hi> and <hi>fetters</hi> that hamper and keep down the <hi>Soul:</hi> He <hi>lets the Priſoners go free,</hi> and ſo makes a releaſe. The <hi>Enemy</hi> comes in, with many <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>perplexities,</hi> and <hi>mists of darkneſs,</hi> and <hi>hard concluſions; Sure God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken and left me for ever; I ſhall come to nothing; He hath brought me into this wilderneſs to deſtroy me:</hi> Theſe bonds lie hard, and oppreſs and keep down the <hi>Soul.</hi> But now <hi>Chriſt</hi> comes and diſcharges the <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> and takes <hi>him that doth let and will let</hi> out of the way: All <hi>iniquity</hi> is made to ſtop her mouth; and the <hi>poor</hi> hath <hi>hope:</hi> And this is one way he takes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt <hi>revives</hi> and <hi>chears</hi> the <hi>Soul</hi> by <hi>unſwadling</hi> and <hi>opening Himſelf</hi> to it: <hi>I am Joſeph your Brother:</hi> And this revives the heart indeed, when Chriſt is open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and revealed to be within, when the <hi>Soul</hi> is made to ſee it is <hi>of kinde to Chriſt,</hi> of <hi>the ſame ſtock,</hi> having <hi>the ſame Father:</hi> He <hi>that ſanctifies, and they that are ſanctified, are all of one.</hi> When this is opened, that there can be a clear witneſſing, <hi>This is the voyce of my
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:169498:26"/>
Beloved; This is He my Soul longed for: He is come, He is come,</hi> as the Martyr cryed out at the ſtake: and they in <hi>Iſaiah, This is our God, we have waited for him; we will rejoyce and be glad in his Salvation.</hi> This is a reviving Cordial.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He <hi>revives the Soul</hi> by preaching <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>good-will</hi> to it: When this voyce comes nigh, <hi>Peace be to this houſe:</hi> Chriſt is called the <hi>Prince of peace,</hi> and none can ſpeak <hi>peace</hi> to the <hi>Soul</hi> but He onely; and before He comes and gets up in the <hi>heart,</hi> there is nothing but <hi>miſts</hi> and <hi>darkneſs</hi> and <hi>confuſions, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities</hi> and <hi>troubles,</hi> which vex and diſquiet the <hi>Soul:</hi> but Chriſt comes preaching <hi>Peace to them that are nigh, and them that are afar off:</hi> That meſſage is brought by an Angel, <hi>Peace be on Earth, and good-will towards men.</hi> And this revives the <hi>heart,</hi> to have theſe <hi>glad tydings of peace</hi> publiſhed, to have <hi>peace</hi> in all thy ways, <hi>peace</hi> at home, and <hi>peace</hi> abroad, <hi>peace</hi> in thy coming in, and <hi>peace</hi> in going out: <hi>Her ways are ways of pleaſantneſs, and all her paths are peace.</hi> This is a way of ſweetneſs indeed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He <hi>revives the Soul</hi> by preaching the <hi>everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gospel</hi> to it. There is a <hi>Gospel,</hi> and an <hi>everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gospel;</hi> the <hi>Gospel</hi> is offered, and tendred, and preached to all, to every Creature; I, but the <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Gospel,</hi> the tydings of that <hi>everlasting Love</hi> and <hi>good-will</hi> to the <hi>Soul,</hi> this is another manner of Goſpel, to have this preached by Chriſt, <hi>Fear not little flock, It is your Fathers good pleaſure to give you the Kingdom:</hi> This takes and revives the <hi>heart,</hi> and chears and ſtrengthens it, and makes it able to run through all <hi>ſnares</hi> and <hi>bonds</hi> and <hi>intangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> when this <hi>everlaſting good-will</hi> is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which ſhall ſound in the Ears to all Eternity.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:169498:27"/>
And this is the ſecond days work: <hi>After two days He will revive us,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And before I leave this, I would you ſhould enquire and ſee, whether you have ever known this <hi>work of Chriſt</hi> or not? Hath the <hi>Son</hi> ever revived you?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Hath Chriſt ever <hi>ſet the Priſoner free</hi> in you? Hath he taken you out of the <hi>Lions mouth?</hi> Hath He broke all your <hi>bonds</hi> and <hi>chains, fears</hi> and <hi>ſcruples,</hi> and <hi>unbelief,</hi> all ſilenced and ſtopped? Have you known this time, when the <hi>ſtrong man</hi> was bound, and caſt out, and ſpoyled of all his <hi>armor?</hi> Did ever the <hi>Father</hi> lift up his <hi>Son</hi> in your view? Were you ever yet removed out of the <hi>Kingdom of Darkneſs</hi> into the <hi>Kingdom of his dear Son?</hi> The <hi>Light</hi> might ſhine upon you in the <hi>firſt days work,</hi> in the work of the <hi>Father,</hi> as the <hi>light</hi> ſhines upon a wall, but enters not through it: <hi>The Light ſhined in the Darkneſs, but the Darkneſs compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended it not.</hi> But now ſee, hath he <hi>tranſlated you out of the Kingdom of Darkneſs</hi> into <hi>his marvelous Light?</hi> If you are not made to know clearly and diſtinctly where you ſtand, and what hath paſſed upon you, and what not; without this you can never go forward, unleſs this <hi>Son</hi> be manifeſt in you, this <hi>Deliverer</hi> ſent from Heaven, who hath the keyes with him to open all doors, and take off all bonds and fetters of fear and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Have you ever known the time when Chriſt unſwadled and opened Himſelf unto you? Can you tell the <hi>day</hi> and <hi>time</hi> and <hi>place</hi> and <hi>ſtrait</hi> you were at, when this was opened clearly, <hi>I am Joſeph your Brother?</hi> This was a <hi>reviving</hi> indeed; if your Souls ever had ſuch an Anſwer as this in ſuch a ſtrait, this would call, and raiſe up from the dead. And then,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Have you ever heard that <hi>everlaſting Gospel</hi>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:169498:27"/>
of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>good-will</hi> preached? That you <hi>are indeed his choſen,</hi> that you <hi>have a ſeed of his own</hi> in you, that you were <hi>choſen</hi> in the <hi>well-beloved</hi> before <hi>the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the World were layd?</hi> However we may <hi>lean,</hi> and <hi>hope,</hi> and <hi>expect,</hi> and <hi>promiſe</hi> our ſelves, yet till this <hi>everlaſting Gospel</hi> be preached to us, we are but uncertain in the bottom of all, and, for ought we know, may be for ever miſerable.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, Who are they that will kill the Body?</p>
                  <p>You may ſee in the Verſes before; Chriſt ſpeaks to his Diſciples, <hi>Behold, I ſend you forth as ſheep amongst Wolves; be ye therefore wiſe as Serpents, and innocent as Doves: But beware of MEN; for they will deliver you up to the Councels,</hi> &amp;c. And it is farther explained, who theſe MEN be, of whom they ſhould beware; Ver. 18. <hi>And you ſhall be brought before Governors and Kings for my ſake, for a testimony againſt them.</hi> And verſ. 21. <hi>And the Brother ſhall deliver up the Brother to death, and the Father the Child; and Children ſhall riſe up againſt their Parents, and cauſe them to be put to death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that theſe MEN are of theſe four ſorts, <hi>Governors, Kings, Brethren,</hi> and <hi>Parents.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Beware of <hi>Kings: Kings</hi> ſhould preſerve their People; and <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Glory of a King is in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:169498:30"/>
the multitude of his People:</hi> And we can truly witneſs for our ſelves, and God is our Witneſs, that we have been and are as <hi>true, faithful,</hi> and <hi>loyal</hi> to the <hi>preſent Government</hi> of the Kingdom, as any other who ever; yet we know not how their hearts may be ordered to conſider of us: Such caſes have been, we know, as that <hi>Kings</hi> have been let out to undo, and pillage, and kill their own Subjects: And though we may yet truly own the many <hi>mercies</hi> and <hi>liberties</hi> we have enjoy'd by this <hi>Parliament;</hi> yet who knows how Things may be turned againſt us? ſuch a caſe may be; Chriſt bids, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of Kings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Beware of <hi>Governors:</hi> Now <hi>Governors</hi> and <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> are appointed of God to be a <hi>Terror of evil works,</hi> but not of <hi>good:</hi> They were ſet to be Defenders and Protectors of them that do well, to defend, to ſecure, to do them <hi>right</hi> and <hi>justice</hi> againſt ſuch as falſly reproach, ſlander, or any ways wrong and injure them; yet <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of men</hi> (ſaith Chriſt:) Governors themſelves ſhall be againſt you, ſuch as ſhould defend and ſecure you. And we have lately had ſome experience of this, how our <hi>Governors,</hi> which ſhould have been our <hi>ſafeguard</hi> and <hi>protection,</hi> that they have ſlighted our Cauſe, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inclined to the <hi>falſe accuſations</hi> of our <hi>adverſaries,</hi> then hear us ſpeak the Truth for our ſelves; nay if the Lord had not prevented it, we might have been knockt on head, and have loſt our lives by the <hi>rude</hi> and <hi>envious multitude</hi> which were ſet againſt us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Brethren: Brother ſhall betray Brother,</hi> &amp;c. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of <hi>Brethren.</hi> And how hath this been made true upon us alſo? Who are they that have been our Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers? that have ſecretly informed and raiſed miſchief a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, and made an <hi>evil</hi> of what they have heard and ſeen amongſt us? were they not our <hi>Brethren?</hi> ſuch
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:169498:31"/>
as were in <hi>ſociety</hi> with us, men of our own <hi>houſe,</hi> and we walked together into the Houſe of <hi>God</hi> as <hi>friends!</hi> ſuch as have heard, and pray'd, and joyned with us, and yet have gone out, becauſe <hi>they were not of us?</hi> Theſe have been our <hi>greateſt Enemies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Children ſhall riſe up againſt their Parents to put them to death.</hi> And how hath this proved true, in my my own child coming as the main Witneſs againſt me? He that came out of my bowels, he was not aſhamed to witneſs falſly againſt me, and to ſay to my face, <hi>He would take a hundread oaths, if he might but enſnare me.</hi> And then, <hi>Parents againſt their children:</hi> This I have proved true alſo. Thoſe that have looked upon themſelves as my Fathers in Chriſt, from whom I have firſt received the Truth, ſuch as have travelled and prayed, yea and witneſſed for me, that I belonged to God; yet how are theſe now ſecretly turned againſt me, and in a treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous undermining way have wrought, and do work what they can to undo me? Such a ſtrange unnaturalneſs is there among men, and if the Lord favour us not, we know not but they may ſee their <hi>wills</hi> accompliſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, and take away our lives: We know not what They may be ſuffered to do againſt us; For, <hi>This is not our Country; our Kingdom is not of this world:</hi> And it is certain, there is <hi>malice</hi> and <hi>envy</hi> enough in all theſe <hi>relations</hi> againſt us, in <hi>Kings, Governors, Brethren, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, Children;</hi> therefore <hi>beware of men,</hi> though your Cauſe be never ſo <hi>just</hi> and <hi>innocent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, What is it to <hi>kill the Body?</hi> How may men do that? what ways may they find out to bring this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout? For though it be not the main thing, or that which we ſhould <hi>fear,</hi> if called to lay down our lives; yet it may be of Uſe to be informed in the ſeveral ways men may take to deſtroy our <hi>Body,</hi> if the Lord prevent not.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:169498:31"/>1. This way they may take to deſtroy the <hi>Body,</hi> by taking away our <hi>eſtates</hi> and <hi>means,</hi> that which ſhould maintain and keep up our <hi>bodies:</hi> Our bread may be taken out of our mouths; we may be ſo impoveriſhed by <hi>Lawyers,</hi> and <hi>Jaylors,</hi> and <hi>Fines,</hi> and <hi>ſtrange ways</hi> that may be found out by our Enemies to waſte our eſtates, that we ſhall not be able to maintain our ſelves. Such dealings ſome of our <hi>Fathers</hi> and the <hi>Martyrs</hi> have met with in their days.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Men may <hi>deſtroy the Body,</hi> by <hi>raiſing ſtrange re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,</hi> and <hi>ſcandals,</hi> and ſuch <hi>evil reports</hi> againſt us, that all men will be ſhy of dealing with us; all our trading and commerce with men, (by which our lives are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly maintained,) may be thus taken from us: As I heard ſome ſay in my own hearing, <hi>Hang them</hi> (ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Us) <hi>they are a baſe reproached people, we'l not buy of them of all others.</hi> And thus, by ſuch ſcandalous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports as theſe, it may grow to that paſs, that we may have neither liberty to buy nor ſell, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another way by which men may deſtroy the <hi>Body,</hi> is, by <hi>binding our hands</hi> that we may not <hi>defend our ſelves,</hi> who ever ſet upon us: And thus we have been dealt with; ſome of us bound to our <hi>good behaviour,</hi> that we may not ſo much as ſtrike a Dog to defend our ſelves; and who ever will, may come and ſet upon us, and we have no remedy in our hands, we may not ſtir a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them for our defence.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Another way they may take to deſtroy our <hi>Bodies,</hi> is, by <hi>lying at the catch</hi> to <hi>inſnare</hi> and <hi>intrap,</hi> and make an <hi>evil</hi> in wreſting words contrary to our <hi>real intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>purpoſes:</hi> As my own ſon was not aſhamed to ſay to my face, <hi>I'le take a hundred oaths, if I could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnare you.</hi> Now what a miſerable caſe is this, if a word ſhould ſlip either unadviſedly, or out of ignorance, that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:169498:32"/>
this ſhould be catched at, and a thing never once thought of, nor intended, charged upon us, even to the hazard of our <hi>lives,</hi> for ought we know.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They may do it another way, as by making an <hi>evil,</hi> in <hi>tentering</hi> our words beyond their <hi>meaning,</hi> ſo by <hi>tentering out the Law</hi> to the utmoſt <hi>exactneſs</hi> and <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour</hi> in all points againſt us; ſo that a man can hardly <hi>ſpeak to another,</hi> or <hi>ſtir any ways in his buſineſs,</hi> but if the Law be reached out, and <hi>tentered to the utmoſt,</hi> he may be found liable to ſome forfeiture or other. You that are ſtrangers this day, and come without any ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent into this Houſe to hear me ſpeak, you might be troubled for coming into the Houſe, or paſſing through a Cloſe without leave; ſuch ſtrange ways may be to tenter out the Law, if the Lord ſhall ſuffer men in this to ſtir againſt us.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Men may <hi>deſtroy the Body,</hi> by raiſing <hi>falſe Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> againſt us, and charge us of that falſly which we are no ways <hi>guilty</hi> of: And thus was Chriſt dealt with; and many of the People of God have been falſly accuſed, falſly witneſſed againſt, and ſo condemned to death. And in our late <hi>Indictment</hi> charged upon us, thoſe that have appeared againſt us, what utter falſneſs hath been in their <hi>oaths,</hi> and witneſſing againſt us? and what further they may be ſuffered to ſwear againſt us, we cannot tell: <hi>and at laſt two falſe Witneſſes</hi> came point-blank againſt Chriſt, and ſo took away his life.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Our <hi>Life</hi> may be taken away by the <hi>Law of Man</hi> ſometimes, when we may be no ways <hi>guilty by the Law of God.</hi> So I remember, when the <hi>Biſhops Courts</hi> were up, ſome have ſaid to me there, <hi>You may be Honeſt, and your way may be good and harmleſs for ought we know, but how ever the Law will not bear you out in it. We have a Law</hi> (ſay they to <hi>Pilate,) and according to that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:169498:32"/>
Law He ought to dye.</hi> And here you ſee are Ways, and Means, and Doors enough open, if the Lord ſtand not for us, and prevent it, by which men may break in upon us, and <hi>deſtroy the Body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus I have ſpoke to you of two of the general Points from the words. 1. Who they be that will <hi>kill the Body;</hi> that Chriſt bids <hi>Beware of, Kings, Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, Brethren, Parents,</hi> and <hi>Children:</hi> This ſeems wonderful unnatural, that theſe of all others ſhould do it, to be for <hi>ſigns</hi> and for <hi>wonders</hi> in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, <hi>I and the children that God hath given me, are for Signs and Wonders in Iſrael.</hi> Were it in <hi>Turkey,</hi> or ſome <hi>forreign Land</hi> to meet with this uſage, it would not be ſo much: But, <hi>Thou my Familiar, my Friend, we took ſweet Counſel together, and walked into the Houſe of God as Friends,</hi> to be Signs and Wonders, a ſcorn, and reproach, and laughing ſtock in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> amongſt men of our own houſe, our own <hi>Rulers,</hi> and <hi>Brethren,</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> this is very unnatural: But, <hi>Beware of men.</hi> And then I have ſhew'd you ſeven Ways by which, if the Lord prevent not, men may come in upon us to deſtroy the <hi>Body.</hi> Now I come to the next general Thing, <hi>Viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Exhortation given, <hi>Fear not them that can kill the Body:</hi> And why ſhould not They be feared?</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. <hi>Fear not,</hi> in regard of them that ſhall do it.</item>
                     <item>2. <hi>Fear not,</hi> in regard it is but the Body they kill.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Fear not them that can kill the Body:</hi> Fear not the men, the perſons that ſhall do it; and that for theſe four Reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe <hi>they are but men,</hi> and man at his <hi>beſt eſtate is altogether vanity.</hi> Alas, They that go about to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:169498:33"/>
kill this body, what are they themſelves, but a <hi>vain thing,</hi> a <hi>nothing,</hi> a <hi>ſhadow,</hi> how ever ſtrong and high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited they may be; yet alas, <hi>all Nations</hi> are but as <hi>the drop of a bucket;</hi> and what is a man, that ſhall ſoon fade as the graſs, that he ſhould be feared?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Fear them not, becauſe they are but <hi>the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Rod</hi> in <hi>the hand of another,</hi> and they cannot move nor ſtir a foot or hand, farther then they ſhall be ſuffered, and permitted, and ordered. They are but like the wheels of a Clock, take off the weights, and the Clock ſtirs not. Alas, though they may threaten, and reſolve, and take counſel never ſo ſtrongly, yet they are not their <hi>own Lords;</hi> they ſhall do neither more nor leſs then the hand will make uſe of the ſword; and therefore our <hi>Fathers</hi> in all their <hi>ſufferings</hi> have looked through and beyond the <hi>inſtrument,</hi> to the <hi>hand</hi> that rules and acts all: <hi>I was dumb</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) and kept ſilence, becauſe it was thy doing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Fear them not, but rather <hi>pity them:</hi> Alas, 'tis <hi>woe,</hi> and <hi>miſery enough</hi> to all ſuch as ſhall have a hand in this work; They are imployed about a hard ſervice, it is their miſery, they are <hi>hackned by the Devil</hi> to do this miſchief againſt the <hi>Truth:</hi> As Chriſt ſaith of <hi>Judas, It had been good for that man he had never been born:</hi> Who ever ſhall be an <hi>inſtrument</hi> in this work, alas 'tis <hi>miſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ry</hi> enough; their <hi>caſe</hi> may be pitied by us, rather then their <hi>malice</hi> feared.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Fear them not in this reſpect, becauſe before their <hi>plots</hi> be ripe they <hi>may be cut off,</hi> and <hi>dye,</hi> and be <hi>layd in their graves.</hi> How many ſuch Caſes have been known? <hi>Haman,</hi> what a ſtrange plot, and how ſurely had he layd it, to cut off the <hi>Jews</hi> root and branch? I, but the miſchief returns upon his own head, before his plot comes to an iſſue, he is cut off himſelf. Alas, how
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:169498:33"/>
ſoon is it done! <hi>His breath is but taken away, and man turns to his earth; and in that very day all his thoughts periſh:</hi> All <hi>plots,</hi> and <hi>deſigns,</hi> and <hi>contrivances</hi> come to nothing. <hi>Remember, O my People</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>what Balack conſulted, and what Balaam anſwered:</hi> And yet ſee how all their <hi>deſigns</hi> were fruſtrate, and blaſted, and came to nothing! And in our own Kingdom, how many <hi>plots</hi> have been thus prevented, when they have been even ripe for execution? So in that <hi>Powder Treaſon,</hi> when all was fit, and but now a candle only wanting to deſtroy and blow up all, yet in the very nick it is found out and prevented: Therefore <hi>fear</hi> them not; if <hi>God will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,</hi> he can ſoon do it; be they never ſo ſtrong, and deſperate, and malicious, yet He can but take away their <hi>breath,</hi> and alas they may be rotten and ſtink in their <hi>graves</hi> before their <hi>plots</hi> are accompliſhed. When <hi>the wicked flouriſh like the graſs,</hi> and <hi>the workers of iniquity like the green herb,</hi> yet then it is that <hi>they might be cut off for ever.</hi> So that were we but truly principled and inſtructed, we might have our <hi>greateſt encouragement,</hi> where we make our <hi>greateſt fears, viz.</hi> from the <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and <hi>heighth,</hi> and <hi>flouriſhing</hi> of our <hi>Enemies,</hi> when they carry all before them; yet <hi>Fear them not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Fear not them that can kill the Body,</hi> in regard of <hi>the Body</hi> which they can kill: They can reach no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then <hi>the Body;</hi> and what is the <hi>Body?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That is but a poor <hi>outſide,</hi> a <hi>ſhadow;</hi> it is but as the cracking of a <hi>ſhell,</hi> to <hi>kill the Body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Body</hi> is a <hi>periſhing thing,</hi> that will ſoon dye of it ſelf; if none ſhould take a ſword againſt it, it will ſoon dye and moulder; 'twill fall of it ſelf: like the fruit of a Tree, let it but alone till it come to be ripe, and you need not ſhake it, the fruit will drop and fall of themſelves.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:169498:34"/>
Therefore <hi>Fear not them that can kill the Body:</hi> They kill but a <hi>dead man,</hi> cut down a little graſs; like <hi>Jonas</hi> gourd, <hi>up in a night, and gone in a night.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Fear them not, for they kill but the <hi>Body,</hi> and that is not that which is to <hi>enter into glory;</hi> this <hi>body</hi> is to <hi>turn to duſt,</hi> this <hi>fleſh and blood</hi> which you ſee <hi>is not to inherit the Kingdom,</hi> this <hi>Corruptible, muſt put on In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption;</hi> this <hi>Corn</hi> muſt <hi>dye,</hi> before it ſhall bring forth that <hi>Body</hi> which is to <hi>abide.

                  </p>
                  <p>And thus far you heard the <hi>Negative</hi> opened, What you are not to fear; <hi>Fear not them that kill the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> &amp;c. And how have moſt of our days hitherto been ſpent about this <hi>body!</hi> and how are the <hi>world,</hi> all of them loſt and drowned in <hi>carings</hi> and <hi>providings</hi> about this? what to eat, and what to drink, and what to put

on? We have been more fooliſh in this, then the <hi>Lillies,</hi> and <hi>Sparrows,</hi> and <hi>Ravens;</hi> they take not theſe <hi>cutting</hi> and <hi>perplexing cares,</hi> and yet they are preſerved and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for; and what have all our <hi>carings</hi> brought about to us but <hi>ſorrows</hi> and <hi>miſery?</hi> they have not added the leaſt cubit to our ſtature. But now we come to the fourth thing.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Who then is to be feared? <hi>Fear him that can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy both ſoul and body in hell:</hi> Fear Him, fear the Lord, He that made thee, He that Rules and Orders all, Fear Him; but why ſhould we fear him?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Fear him becauſe we are his Workmanſhip, he is our <hi>Maker;</hi> he is the <hi>Potter</hi> and we are his <hi>clay:</hi> we had our <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Frame</hi> and <hi>mould,</hi> and all we have from him.</p>

How ſoon was <hi>Judas</hi> ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and twiſted out of all his <hi>mercy,</hi> and preſently left to <hi>ruine?</hi> He was but now among the Diſciples, and lookt upon as one of them, (for they all queſtioned themſelves as much as him,) and by and by he hangs himſelf, when he is but left to have his run; and therefore (ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid) Thou holdeſt our ſouls in life;</hi> if he do not hold and maintain and keep up thy life every moment, alas thou art ſoon gone and wilt ſink to nothing: when thou art in thy <hi>jollity</hi> and <hi>mirth,</hi> in the midſt of thy bouls, if a <hi>hand writing</hi> do but come againſt thee, how ſoon may thy mirth be quaſhed, the <hi>knees</hi> tremble and knock together, and the <hi>face</hi> be turned to paleneſs?

the beſt, much like a ſtout reſolved Souldier, riding up bravely furniſhed, and with a courage to charge in the face of an Enemy, but on a ſuddain a bullet comes and lays him down, and all his ſtrength and courage is gone in a moment; ſo ſoon can this Lord take thee off, in any of thy injoyments, therefore <hi>Fear Him.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Fear Him,</hi> becauſe He will certainly bring thee to <hi>judgment;</hi> he wil call thee to <hi>an account</hi> for all thy ways That which hath been done <hi>in ſecret,</hi> which <hi>no eye ſaw,</hi> and <hi>no man</hi> could ever <hi>charge thee with;</hi> all thy <hi>ſecret thoughts,</hi> thy <hi>covetings,</hi> and <hi>lustings,</hi> and <hi>envyings,</hi> the <hi>ſecret turnings</hi> within, He will bring all upon the ſtage, nothing ſhall paſs: therefore <hi>fear this Judg;</hi> for <hi>Thou knoweſt not at what hour thy Lord may come.</hi> And, <hi>Good Lord!</hi> if He come in a time unthought of, and finde thee <hi>froward,</hi> and <hi>fretting,</hi> and <hi>envying,</hi> and <hi>luſting,</hi> and <hi>ſaving thy life</hi> in any <hi>creature;</hi> Alas! what then will become of thee? if thou beeſt thus ſurprized,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:169498:35"/>
(and ſurprize thee He may;) For we know not the <hi>hour</hi> when the <hi>Thief</hi> will come; therefore there is cauſe to <hi>fear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Fear Him,</hi> becauſe <hi>there is mercy with Him, that He may be feared:</hi> He will have a <hi>reward</hi> for them that fear him. If thou <hi>fear men,</hi> either they may neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and not minde to reward thee; or elſe may not be able: but <hi>the Lord will ſurely reward them that fear Him, and thoſe that wait on Him ſhall not be aſhamed.</hi> And therefore there is great reaſon from theſe ſeveral Particulars, why He ſhould be feared.</p>
                  <p>And now I ſhall ſpeak of the two other general Points from the words, which come in as an enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and farther ground of this <hi>Exhortation; Fear Him that can deſtroy both Soul and Body in Hell:</hi> where theſe two things are yet to be opened; <hi>What it is to have the Soul deſtroyed?</hi> and then <hi>what it is to be in Hell?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, What is it to have <hi>the Soul deſtroyed?</hi> what ways doth God take to do that?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He <hi>destroys the Soul</hi> by <hi>withdrawing the ſap which ſhould maintain it;</hi> when God gives up the Soul to it ſelf, and leaves <hi>ſtriving,</hi> and <hi>motioning,</hi> and <hi>knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> this is one way by which it is <hi>ſurely destroyed:</hi> For it will ſoon dye and ſink of it ſelf, if it be not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and hunted, and kept up, and maintained dayly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another way of <hi>deſtroying the Soul,</hi> is, when God gives it up <hi>to beleeve lyes,</hi> to feed on aſhes; and that, like a <hi>canker,</hi> will ſoon eat out all the <hi>life</hi> and <hi>power</hi> and <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>Truth:</hi> The <hi>Soul</hi> is made uncapable of receiving <hi>Truth,</hi> nothing can enter nor ſeize: Though there be never ſuch a <hi>power</hi> and <hi>ſtrength</hi> and <hi>clearneſs</hi> in the <hi>Word,</hi> yet nothing can take place: and this is the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:169498:36"/>
wonder that God ſpeaks; <hi>I will work a wonder in your days that a man ſhall not beleeve, though it be told him; I will deſtroy the wiſdom of the wiſe.</hi> And again; <hi>In hearing they ſhall hear, and not perceive; and in ſeeing they ſhall not ſee;</hi> becauſe a <hi>deceived heart</hi> hath turned them aſide, <hi>given up to beleeve lyes, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another way of <hi>destroying the Soul,</hi> is, by <hi>leaving it alone out of the Nurſery,</hi> out of the <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>care</hi> of the <hi>People of God,</hi> that there is none to take it in, none to look over it, nor enquire after it; none to turn aſide to ask how it doth: Alaſs! this will ſoon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Soul, to be thus caſt off, and left alone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>care</hi> and <hi>counſel</hi> and <hi>pity</hi> and <hi>encouragement</hi> of the <hi>Truth;</hi> to have none to plant, nor water, nor till it; that ground can bring forth nothing but <hi>bryars</hi> and <hi>thorns,</hi> and ſo is <hi>nigh unto curſing, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Another way God takes, when the Decrees are gone forth, to undo a Soul, is this; He <hi>ſhuts out all prayers,</hi> and <hi>intreaties,</hi> and <hi>means,</hi> that are uſed to turn his heart to the <hi>creature,</hi> that nothing ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with Him; though there ſhould be any to ſtand up to pray and plead, yet He will not hear. Though <hi>Samuel</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> ſhould <hi>ſtand up, yet could not my heart be turned towards this people: Put them out of my ſight</hi> (ſaith God.) And ſo to <hi>Samuel</hi> God an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers; <hi>Why prayeſt thou any more for</hi> Saul? <hi>I have caſt him off.</hi> And this is a ſure way of undoing the Soul indeed: If God be againſt it, who can ſtand for it? who can deliver out of his hand?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Another way the <hi>Soul</hi> is deſtroyed by, is, when <hi>God takes away all its gates and fences,</hi> and lays it open to <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>Satan</hi> to have their full courſe and run, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtop or let: All the <hi>floods of ungodlineſs</hi> and <hi>troops of wickedneſs</hi> may come in at pleaſure, and overflow
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:169498:36"/>
and overſpread the Soul, ſo that nothing at all can be ſeen, but <hi>envy,</hi> and <hi>luſt, malice,</hi> and <hi>deceits:</hi> the <hi>man</hi> is <hi>moulded</hi> and <hi>changed</hi> into the very <hi>image of the Devil.</hi> I have known ſome men ſo wholy drunk up of the <hi>Devil,</hi> that no <hi>Reaſon</hi> nor <hi>Senſe,</hi> nothing of <hi>parts</hi> and <hi>reaſonableneſs,</hi> hath been left, but the very <hi>minde</hi> and <hi>dispoſition</hi> of the <hi>Devil</hi> hath been in all. And this is to be undone indeed, it is the very <hi>destruction.</hi> And this is a ſad condition ſure, to have the Soul thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed: Was ever <hi>ſorrow</hi> or <hi>miſery</hi> like this? Is there not reaſon <hi>He ſhould be feared</hi> that can <hi>deſtroy the Soul</hi> with ſuch a <hi>deſtruction</hi> as this? Look over it again: 1. If God <hi>withdraws his ſap,</hi> that which <hi>enlivens</hi> and <hi>quickens</hi> and <hi>keeps up the Soul,</hi> how ſurely doth all dye of it ſelf, and decay and wither! And may He not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw if He pleaſe? Is he bound to us? Then, 2. To be <hi>given up to beleeve lyes,</hi> to lie under the <hi>power of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,</hi> that nothing of <hi>Truth</hi> can reach the Soul; how miſerable is this? And then, 3. To be left here in the mire; to be left thus wounded of Thieves, and half dead, and no good <hi>Samaritan</hi> to take pity, nor look for cure, for it; to have none to care, nor ſupport, nor look after it, but be like a <hi>member</hi> cut off from the <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;</hi> how ſoon muſt that needs dye and wither! And then, 4. To have the <hi>anger of God</hi> ſo far kindled and gone forth, that He will not hear any <hi>prayers</hi> or <hi>cries</hi> that ſhall be put up for the Soul; <hi>Pray no more for this people.</hi> When God will by no means be entreated to have mercy, this is ſad. And laſtly, To be wholy left and given up into the hands and will of the <hi>Devil,</hi> to be ruled at his pleaſure, and left wholy to be ſwallowed up of <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>ungodlineſs,</hi> that nothing elſe appears but the very <hi>Image of Hell</hi> and the <hi>Devil;</hi> this is a whole <hi>deſtruction</hi> indeed: and wo to the man or woman that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:169498:37"/>
is thus beſet, that hath no place to turn to, nor way for help or cure: This is a <hi>deſtruction</hi> to be feared indeed: <hi>Fear Him that can</hi> thus <hi>deſtroy Soul and Body. Take heed</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>leſt there be any profane perſon as</hi> Eſau, <hi>who for one morſel ſold his birth-right;</hi> and if you are not here prevented, you are for ever miſerable: and the ſame thing, is <hi>in you,</hi> that would thus deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly throw away <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Heaven,</hi> and <hi>all,</hi> for a trifle, any vain luſt: and to be here prevented, and not ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to undo our ſelves, is <hi>a mercy worth ten thouſand worlds:</hi> Therefore <hi>fear not them that can kill the Body.</hi> Alaſs! that is but a poor thing, not worth the ſpeaking of, in compare of this <hi>deſtroying the Soul:</hi> but <hi>Fear Him who can deſtroy with this deſtruction.</hi> This I would have you minde, That <hi>Men,</hi> whom Chriſt counſels not to <hi>fear,</hi> they can reach but the <hi>Body,</hi> there they begin and there end, in <hi>killing the Body:</hi> But God, when he ſets againſt a man, He begins with the Soul; <hi>Fear Him that can deſtroy Soul and Body:</hi> the Soul firſt; and that may be ſtruck at, and have a wound, though the Body live; He begins there to ſtrike and blaſt; the <hi>Soul</hi> firſt, and then the <hi>Body</hi> that will ſoon <hi>pine</hi> and <hi>fall</hi> and <hi>dye</hi> and <hi>come to nothing.</hi> And now to the laſt thing.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, What is it to be in Hell? <hi>Fear Him that can deſtroy both Soul and Body in Hell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It hath theſe three degrees in it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To be in <hi>Hell</hi> is to be <hi>ſenſibly knowing</hi> that the <hi>Soul is excluded from God,</hi> and <hi>hath no fellowſhip nor communion with him.</hi> All the World are in Hell; they have no <hi>knowledg</hi> nor <hi>fellowſhip</hi> nor <hi>union</hi> with <hi>God:</hi> I, but the <hi>ſenſe</hi> is not upon them; they know it not, but cover themſelves with a covering of falſhood and lyes; and hope and beleeve that God loves them, when they
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:169498:37"/>
have no ground, nor know any ſuch thing. But now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when any ſhall be awakened, and rouzed, and made to ſee their condition, and ſenſibly know they are ignorant of God; live at a diſtance from him, and are ſo ſhut out and excluded, as they cannot turn any ways to get to Him; and know not whether ever they ſhall be brought to <hi>ſee the Kings face,</hi> or not; whether they ſhall be ſo far favored or not: I ſay, the <hi>felt ſenſe</hi> of this <hi>excluſion from God</hi> is the firſt degree of <hi>Hell.</hi> And this God can ſoon do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He can ſoon awake and rouze, and open how the caſe ſtands with the Soul, that it may cry out with <hi>Cain, My Puniſhment is greater then I can bear.</hi> There are many in the world, were they but brought to a ſtrait to know their conditions, would be found here in <hi>Cains</hi> caſe, <hi>ſhut out from the Preſence of God;</hi> and therefore they hate the <hi>Light,</hi> and are afraid to come to be judged by it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another degree of being in <hi>Hell</hi> is, when the Soul is made to <hi>feel the very Pains and Torments of Hell,</hi> to go under the <hi>gnaw</hi> of <hi>that worm</hi> of <hi>conſcience,</hi> which continually dogs, and gnaws, and torments the Soul day and night; <hi>The pains of Hell took hold upon me</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,) the ſorrows of Death encompaſſed me.</hi> He was brought to this ſtep of Hell, to have no reſt nor quiet in all his ways; but he was not <hi>given over unto Death;</hi> The <hi>Pit</hi> did not ſhut her mouth upon him: <hi>Thou wilt not leave my Soul in Hell</hi> (ſaith he,) <hi>nor ſuffer thy Holy One to ſee corruption:</hi> That was his <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>ſalvation, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The laſt ſtep of <hi>Hell,</hi> which makes all up, (for, as I ſaid, the children of God may, and do many times paſs through the two former,) but this makes it up to be <hi>Hell</hi> indeed, when <hi>Everlaſtingneſs</hi> is added to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>Go ye curſed into Everlasting Fire;</hi> when there
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:169498:38"/>
is an <hi>everlasting Sentence of Excluſion;</hi> when <hi>the great gulph</hi> is ſet, as <hi>Abraham</hi> anſwered, <hi>Between us and you is a great gulph ſet, that they that would come from you to us, cannot, &amp;c.</hi> This is the <hi>Hell</hi> indeed. And the Time is coming that this will grow up to be more known in the World, that <hi>men</hi> ſhall have <hi>their Hell</hi> opened, and their <hi>ſentence</hi> read in their own <hi>conſciences<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> For how have all things been in the dark hitherto! How few of the <hi>Children of God</hi> in former days have had a <hi>clear, evident</hi> and <hi>certain knowledg</hi> of their <hi>Salvation?</hi> And ſo for the <hi>children</hi> of the <hi>Devil,</hi> how few have had their <hi>conſciences</hi> opened, and <hi>condemnation</hi> ſealed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but have ſlept out their days ſottiſhly, and gone <hi>hood-winked</hi> to <hi>Hell.</hi> But as the <hi>Truth</hi> ſhall get up to open <hi>Salvation</hi> to the <hi>ſons</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that <hi>that</hi> is their lot and portion; ſo certainly will it grow up for others to be divided to their own ſtock and kinde, and go under the feeling and ſenſe of their <hi>condemnation;</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith of ſome, <hi>whoſe damnation ſlumbreth not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now what ſhall I ſay to you more? but this:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If it be poſſible, that ſome of you might be warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>never to come to this place of torment,</hi> to taſte the <hi>ſorrows of Death,</hi> and <hi>feel the pains of Hell;</hi> to have the <hi>Soul deſtroyed,</hi> to be <hi>turned into Hell with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly.</hi> Oh! who can expreſs the <hi>miſery?</hi> What have we been upon, <hi>caring</hi> and <hi>fearing</hi> about the <hi>Body,</hi> and them that can kill it? but alaſs! this is the thing to be feared, to have <hi>Soul and Body deſtroyed in Hell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Then you that are to be ſaved, and truly belong to God, and have had <hi>true hints</hi> in your ſelves, and a <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> from others to that purpoſe; yet ſee what may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall you, how far you may be let go, how neer <hi>deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> you may come: you may be <hi>caſt into the belly of Hell,</hi> ſo was <hi>Jonah;</hi> and <hi>feel the pains of Hell,</hi> ſo did
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:169498:38"/>
                     <hi>David;</hi> and be <hi>ſhut out from all enjoyment of God,</hi> ſo was <hi>Job,</hi> that he could not finde him: though he went forward and backward, on the right hand and on the left, yet no entrance could be found: but their <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>ſalvation</hi> was in being <hi>brought out of Hell.</hi> But now becauſe you have yet no certain knowledg of your latter end, how God will deal with you; if the ſenſe of what I have ſaid were upon you, it would put you to a great ſtrait to <hi>know the end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Stand in awe, leſt this day overtake you unawares;</hi> you know not what ſhall happen, therefore <hi>ſtand in awe, and fear.</hi>

The <hi>compact City,</hi> ſuch as are made up and <hi>compact of God and Man</hi> in one perſon (according to the Pattern their elder Brother <hi>Chriſt)</hi> the <hi>Humanity</hi> and <hi>Divinity</hi> joyned in together, God with man and in man; <hi>Chriſt in you the hope of glory:</hi> For all others (in whom ſomething of God is not) are but a meer outſide and ſhadow; but where ever in any man this <hi>Divinity</hi> is joyned, in, and to, the <hi>Humanity,</hi> there is the <hi>compact Jeruſalem:</hi> of ſuch members is that City made: the <hi>Jeruſalem from above,</hi> which is the <hi>Mother of us all.</hi> And, 3.

ſhall be willing, and embrace and receive Him, in the <hi>day of his power;</hi> they ſhall be a <hi>willing people:</hi> and this He joys at; in hope that he ſhall ſee <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; that his people ſhall not always be ſcorning, and deſpiſing, and kicking againſt the <hi>Truth;</hi> that they ſhall not always be covering and hiding themſelves, and ſtand out againſt their own <hi>mercies:</hi> but the year of <hi>Jubilee</hi> will come, the day will be, when <hi>God will break the yoke from off their neck, and ſet them free:</hi> And then (ſaith <hi>David) I will run the ways of thy Commandments, when thou haſt ſet my feet at liberty.</hi> Then all his Love will be owned, and received, and prized: He ſhall be welcom to them then; even the <hi>feet</hi> of ſuch as bring <hi>glad tydings of peace:</hi> Then will the Soul ſay with <hi>Abigail, Let me waſh the feet of the ſervants of my Lord the King.</hi> He ſhall be welcom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in that day: And this glads, and rejoyces, and keeps up his ſpirit, to think on this time. <hi>I had verily fainted</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) unleſs I had beleeved to ſee the goodneſs of the Lord in the Land of the Living:</hi> That bare up his heart. <hi>There is hope in the latter end</hi> (ſaith God to <hi>Rachel) that thy Children ſhall come again to their own borders.</hi> How ever they are now in <hi>captivity,</hi> and lie ſcattered &amp; broken, as if utterly forſaken; yet they ſhall <hi>return.</hi> And for theſe cauſes Chriſt weeps over <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> over his people, out of joy, where ever and in what caſe ſoever he finds them: yet this <hi>joy lives in the bottom.</hi> I would you might never forget theſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>And when He beheld the City, He wept.</hi> Another Reaſon why He weeps, is out of <hi>ſorrow,</hi> becauſe He findes them <hi>in their blood:</hi> He grieves to ſee <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lems</hi> wickedneſs, to ſee her hands embrued in blood; to ſee her killing the Prophets, and oppoſing and fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:169498:43"/>
againſt her own good. There is no other way for Her ever to be ſaved, but by hearing the voyce of her Prophets, and obeying them: And now, to thruſt theſe away, ſaying, <hi>We will not have this man rule over us;</hi> for <hi>Truth</hi> to finde the <hi>ſons of peace,</hi> the <hi>ſaved ones,</hi> in this ſtrange condition, hating and ſtriking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their own chief good, and beſt friends, This cauſes a <hi>weeping.</hi> It is a gladneſs indeed to finde the <hi>ſons of peace;</hi> to ſee a <hi>Nathanael,</hi> an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>in whom there is no guile; one</hi> in whom the <hi>Spirit of Life,</hi> the <hi>Seed of God,</hi> is planted; <hi>Truth</hi> joys at this: and if this be not in the bottom, there is no ground for <hi>Truth</hi> to work upon: No Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian goes about to take a dead man to cure. If there be not a <hi>Seed of Life,</hi> there is nothing for <hi>Truth</hi> to care for, and pray and weep over: But now where that <hi>ſeed</hi> is, yet to finde ſuch a Soul, or ſuch a people, ſtoning their Prophets; to finde his own Children rebelling and ſtanding againſt Him; this cauſes <hi>Truth</hi> to weep: <hi>And when He beheld the City, He wept, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this Sin hath three <hi>Aggravations</hi> in it, which cauſe <hi>Truth</hi> to weep.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is an <hi>unnatural ſin</hi> for them to kill their Prophets, which came to inſtruct and inform them in the way of <hi>Life.</hi> Alaſs! in <hi>killing your Prophets,</hi> you <hi>kill your ſelves;</hi> you murther your own Souls: And what murther is ſo cruel and unnatural as that? Who ſhall <hi>ſave you,</hi> if you <hi>kill your Saviour?</hi> Him whom God hath ſent to be a <hi>Saviour</hi> and <hi>Deliverer?</hi> If you thruſt away this <hi>Moſes,</hi> who ſhal bring you out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and lead through the Wilderneſs? Nothing ſo unnatural as for a man to cut his own Throat; ſuch a thing is it for any to ſlight and contemn that <hi>Truth</hi> which comes to ſave them.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:169498:44"/>2. It is an <hi>ungrateful Sin.</hi> It is not right, nor allowable, to render <hi>evil</hi> for <hi>evil,</hi> to <hi>hate our Enemies:</hi> But to reward <hi>evil</hi> for <hi>good,</hi> to return <hi>hatred</hi> for <hi>love</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>bowels</hi> ſhewed us; <hi>(Am I therefore your Enemy</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) becauſe I tell you the truth?)</hi> This is wonderful ungrateful. <hi>I will ſend my Son, ſure they will reverence Him:</hi> but now after all to take <hi>this Son</hi> too, and kill Him, that was ſent out of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tenderneſs;</hi> this is the <hi>ungratefulleſt ſin</hi> in the World: To refuſe <hi>Him that ſpeaks from Heaven,</hi> that can open to you the <hi>minde</hi> and <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>love</hi> and <hi>good-will</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> this Chriſt weeps at, to finde them in ſo ungrateful a ſin.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is a <hi>venturous and desperate ſin;</hi> That moves Chriſt to weep, to ſee the hard venture: what, to ſleep upon the top of a Maſt! To venture to kill their Prophets, and the preſent offer of Grace, and know not whether ever another Prophet ſhall be ſent them or no; O what a <hi>venture</hi> is it! God hath truly ſent me to you, to warn you to come out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and to tell you, <hi>God hath purpoſed to deſtroy the City;</hi> and will you venture to linger in it ſtill? Had <hi>Lot</hi> ſtayd but one hour longer, he had been deſtroyed with them: but the <hi>Angel</hi> layd hands on him, and pulled him out, <hi>the Lord being mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to him:</hi> This is the next to that unpardonable ſin, which <hi>David</hi> prays againſt; <hi>O keep me from preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſins, that I may be innocent from the great Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion.</hi> The Lord warn and prevent you, and lay it to your heart to conſider, how guilty we are in all theſe Particulars; how unnatural we have been and cruel to our own Souls, to murther the <hi>Truth</hi> ſent to gather us; and then of all tranſgreſſions 'tis the moſt ungrateful. What people in all the world have been ſo kindly dealt with? ſo followed, and waited on, and born with? Line
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:169498:44"/>
upon Line, Inſtruction, and Counſel, and Love, have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed us; and to murther this <hi>Truth</hi> after all, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful is it? And then how deſperate have we been and venturous, in a Paſſion (like the profane <hi>Eſau</hi>) to <hi>ſell all for one morſel of bread,</hi> to <hi>venture all</hi> at a blow? and what ever comes on it, deſperately reſolve, <hi>We will not have this man rule over us.</hi> Well may God ſay to us, <hi>Becauſe I would have purged you, and you would not be purged, therefore you ſhall not be purged till you dye.</hi> Do you hear what is ſpoke? It concerns all; you are all guilty, the Lord lay it not to your charge. I know not a People in the World ſo venturing all at a caſt, as we have been. Come Life or Death, yet there hath been a punctual ſtanding out and ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Call of <hi>Truth,</hi> to have our wills.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Another Cauſe Chriſt weeps over <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> is, to find her in that <hi>miſerable condition of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> that ſhe <hi>knew not the Things which belonged to her Peace: O that Thou hadſt known, even Thou, in this thy day,</hi> &amp;c. But <hi>They knew not the day of their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation,</hi> they knew not their time; this Chriſt grieves at. <hi>Work whileſt it is day, whileſt you have the Light with you; for the night cometh wherein no man can work.</hi> But they had played in Summer, they ſlighted their ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and opportunities, and knew them not; <hi>knew not the Things belonging to their Peace.</hi> Man naturally looks after the things that concern his <hi>eaſe,</hi> but is not ſo minding what belongs to his <hi>peace.</hi> But it is this <hi>Peace</hi> only that muſt ſtick by us in a ſtrait, in a time of need; when <hi>eaſe,</hi> and <hi>enlargements,</hi> and all fail, then will this <hi>Peace</hi> abide; and this Chriſt weeps for, to ſee their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, though it is well in one reſpect that they were ignorant: <hi>I obtained mercy</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) becauſe I did
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:169498:45"/>
it ignorantly.</hi> And had we done what we have done, fully knowing, we had ſinned that <hi>unpardonable Sin,</hi> and there could have been no mercy for us.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>What was Jeruſalem ignorant of?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>She was ignorant of her Day: <hi>O that thou hadſt known in this thy Day!</hi> It was the <hi>time</hi> and day of her <hi>Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and ſhe knows it not. <hi>This day</hi> (ſaith <hi>Samuel</hi> to <hi>Saul) would the Lord have establiſhed the Kingdom upon thee,</hi> had he known the time, and ſtood in that nick; but falling there, he loſt all. So the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> ſhe looked for the <hi>Meſſias</hi> to come, and that <hi>He would tell her all things;</hi> but ſhe was ignorant of the preſent ſeaſon, ſhe knew not that He was the <hi>Meſſias</hi> who now talked with her. So have we been hoping, and expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and promiſing our ſelves great things for the future; but have not known the <hi>preſent day,</hi> and the <hi>preſent mercies</hi> offered us. For my own part, had I known my time and day afforded me, I can truly ſay, I had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented of many of the miſeries, miſchiefs and miſcarries that I have fallen into: And how many times have you killed the <hi>ſtrugglings</hi> and <hi>motionings</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> in you, and ſaid, <hi>To morrow we will conſider of it, and hear and come up to what is called for?</hi> when alas, to <hi>morrow</hi> is not ours, we know not but this may be the day; and if this be ſlipt over by us, it may never be offered more: but we are reaſoning and diſputing away the time, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<q>
                        <hi>Sure</hi> this is not the call and mind of <hi>Truth,</hi> this would make me a ſcorn and hiſſing ſtock to all, ſure this would undo me:</q>
And thus we are keeping off our <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</hi> No, but we judg amiſs; He would bring thee to Himſelf, to <hi>know the things that belong to thy Peace,</hi> to have <hi>Peace</hi> in all thou goeſt about, which is worth all. We have now no <hi>Peace</hi> in all our ways, turn whither we will, to eating, and drinking, and trading, to all our
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:169498:45"/>
                     <hi>employments</hi> and <hi>enjoyments;</hi> yet nothing ſhall give reſt and eaſe to them that are to be ſaved, till this <hi>Peace</hi> be given, and this Chriſt weeps for, that this <hi>Peace</hi> ſhould be no more known nor minded by <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> but the time ſlipt over, and loſt and gone, whileſt we ſtand and oppoſe our own Salvation, and would never come at it. But you will ſay, Is ſuch a Thing in man that would not be ſaved, and come to know the <hi>things which belong to his Peace,</hi> and <hi>everlasting good?</hi> I, there is that which oppoſeth it to the Death, if the Lord prevent not. But how ever the <hi>Soul may be ſaved in the day of the Lord,</hi> yet a great Loſs may come, the <hi>inlargements</hi> and <hi>attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> may be loſt. <hi>But now they are hid from thine eyes,</hi> &amp;c. and much miſery &amp; ſorrows may be brought on our heads, as in the Verſe following, <hi>Thine enemies ſhall caſt a trench about thee, and keep thee in on every ſide, and not leave one ſtone upon another,</hi> &amp;c. Methinks while I read and conſider it, to whom he ſpeaks, to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> that God ſhould deal thus exactly, and be ſo ſevere and harſh to his own People, this is marvelous, and makes my heart ake to think on it, and yet thus He will deal with <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> I told you, the high nature of their ſin to deſtroy their Prophets, is, 1. An <hi>unnatural ſin,</hi> it is to kill their own Souls. And, 2. An <hi>ungrateful ſin,</hi> againſt all <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>mercy,</hi> and <hi>tenderneſs,</hi> a requiting of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt evil for the greateſt good. And then, 3. What a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is it to run ſuch a deſperate hazard? who, that ſhould ſee this in himſelf, and have the ſenſe ſeize upon him, would not cry out, <hi>O what have I done!</hi> I remember it was ſo with me in my day, when Chriſt was offered to me, and my Soul drew back, &amp; refuſed <hi>the Lamb of God,</hi> that which I had ſo long cryed, and prayed, and longed for; yet when offered to me, <hi>Lo here is my Son,</hi> that then I ſhould refuſe it, Lord (I ſaid to my Soul) what have
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:169498:46"/>
                     <q>I done! what will become of me! what now can ſave me!</q> Then another Cauſe of Chriſts weeping over <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> I told you, was their Ignorance, that <hi>They knew not the things which belonged to their Peace;</hi> and what Things were they? Why (ſaith Chriſt,) <hi>How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten would I have gathered thee, as a Hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and you would not?</hi> They knew not the goodneſs of the Lord, the day of Grace offered, that then He was calling, and inviting, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering them to Himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Now this I would bring home to our ſelves, to ſee how it will parallel with our conditions, whether the Lord hath not thus ſought to gather us in our day as a Hen gathereth her Chickens.</p>
                  <p>In which theſe ſeveral things are Conſiderable.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A Hen calleth her Chickens after her, ſhe goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and clocks, and clocks to call them together, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her, till ſhe gets them all about her; and ſo hath the Lord dealt with us, the <hi>Call of Truth</hi> hath reached us, and brought us together out of ſeveral <hi>Countries,</hi> and <hi>places,</hi> and <hi>conditions;</hi> one Call of the <hi>Truth</hi> hath met with us, and brought us together.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Hen,</hi> after ſhe hath gathered her chickens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her, ſhe ſits down and ſettles in ſome place; and ſo hath <hi>Truth;</hi> now it hath gathered us together, it hath ſat down amongſt us, it hath taken up a ſetled place of abode, that we are not now wanderlng abroad to find a <hi>Truth,</hi> or a People to joyn with.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. After the <hi>Hen</hi> hath called her chickens together, and ſat down in her place, the next thing ſhe doth, is this, ſhe ſpreads forth and opens her wings to receive and take them in: ſo hath the <hi>Truth</hi> opened and ſpread forth the wings of its <hi>favor,</hi> and <hi>goodneſs,</hi> and <hi>entertainment;</hi> the way is open and free, all that will may come under
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:169498:46"/>
and find acceptance and tendering, all that are the chick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens indeed, that belong to this <hi>Hen,</hi> to this <hi>Truth,</hi> and not of a falſe brood.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>Hen</hi> receives her chickens under her wings to <hi>warm, cheriſh,</hi> and <hi>revive</hi> them; and that is the end of <hi>Truths</hi> gathering and opening it ſelf to receive and take us in, to <hi>fellowſhip,</hi> and <hi>counſel,</hi> and <hi>unity;</hi> it is that we might be <hi>warmed,</hi> and <hi>helped,</hi> and <hi>relieved,</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper. If two lie together, there is heat; but how can one be warm alone?</hi> Take a quick coal out of the fire, and it dyeth preſently: And the Holy Ghoſt ſays, <hi>Wo to him that is alone.</hi> But the Proſpering way that <hi>Truth</hi> calls to, is, where <hi>Brethren live together in unity,</hi> to <hi>come under one wing,</hi> for <hi>counſel,</hi> and <hi>help,</hi> and <hi>direction</hi> in all our ways.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The <hi>Hen</hi> gathers her chickens under her wings, as to warm and cheriſh them, ſo to <hi>protect</hi> and <hi>keep</hi> them out of danger and harms; the <hi>Kite,</hi> or ſome ravenous thing or other, ſoon catches them, when they leave the Hen, and ſtraggle alone: And this is a certainty, whileſt we <hi>ſtand alone</hi> by our ſelves out of the counſel, and care, and ſubmiſſion under <hi>Truth,</hi> we are open to a thouſand dangers and miſcarriages, we lie expoſed to all ravenous beaſts: The <hi>Avenger of Blood</hi> he may juſtly take us, when we are out of our <hi>City of Refuge;</hi> and this wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering hath been the Cauſe of all our deſolation, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and ſorrows.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The laſt thing in the <hi>Hens</hi> calling, and gathering, and receiving, and warming, and protecting her chickens, all is, that ſhe may <hi>nurſe them up to perfection,</hi> to be like her ſelf, to be able to ſhift abroad, and defend themſelves: And this end <hi>Truth</hi> hath had in all its <hi>dealings</hi> with us, and <hi>followings</hi> after us, and <hi>waitings</hi> upon us, that we might grow up to be like-minded to it ſelf, to ſee us
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:169498:47"/>
wrought, and molded, and faſhioned into the ſame like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that <hi>the ſame mind might dwell in us which dwelt in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now look it over again: Have you known theſe <hi>things which belong to your Peace?</hi> Have you known that all theſe dealings and calls of <hi>Truth,</hi> and ſtrivings with you, were in <hi>love</hi> and <hi>goodneſs?</hi> that this was <hi>the day of Viſitation?</hi> and have you accepted of this <hi>Love?</hi> See: 1. Have you not been called out of ſeveral places, many miles aſunder, to come together? Hath not the ſound of <hi>Truth</hi> gone forth, and reached you, and called you to it? And, 2. Do you not ſee that the <hi>Hen</hi> is now ſat down? that the <hi>Truth</hi> is pitched, and hath taken up a ſetled place and People? and now if we ſhould be broken in pieces, and ſhattered hither and thither to our former ſcattering in the world, would it not be ſad and miſerable? And this I fear may befall us, becauſe we have ſlighted, and not taken notice of this day of our <hi>mercies.</hi> Then, 3. Have we not known and felt the <hi>warmings</hi> and <hi>cheerings</hi> of the Powers of <hi>Truth?</hi> How often have we found <hi>our hearts touched</hi> within, and heat, and warmed, and turned? and yet for all this we are loth to come under the wing, but are upon our <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings,</hi> and <hi>deferrings,</hi> and <hi>ſcruples.</hi> Then, 4. Have we not known what a <hi>ſhelter</hi> and <hi>ſafeguard</hi> it is, to ſit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>wing of Truth?</hi> what a defence and ſafety? how ſafe we are under the <hi>wings of the Almighty?</hi> We do not at preſent ſo conſider this: But they that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of this mercy, and violently taken away from us by wicked hands, They now feel the loſs, and bitterly complain and mourn under it; They find what <hi>ſnares,</hi> and <hi>baits,</hi> and <hi>ravenous beasts</hi> lie dayly at watch ready to devour them; and if the Lord prevent not beyond our deſervings, we know not what miſeries and ſorrows
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:169498:47"/>
may befall us, if a ſcattering day come. And laſtly, I told you, the <hi>Hen nurſes her chickens,</hi> to bring them up to be like her ſelf: And hath not this been aimed at in all the dealings of <hi>Truth</hi> with us, that we might grow up to be like it ſelf, and be moulded into the ſame Image? And we can never grow up, whileſt we live at a diſtance from the <hi>Hen,</hi> the place where ſhe ſits down to warm, and brood, and cheriſh her young ones: And therefore at what a ſtrait was <hi>David,</hi> when driven into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by his ſon? How doth he cry out, That his <hi>Soul was athirſt for the living God?</hi> How doth he then prize the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> the Place and People of <hi>Gods Worſhip?</hi> How doth he envy the <hi>Sparrow</hi> and <hi>Swallow,</hi> which could make their neſts there, when he was forced to live at a diſtance? For there he knew the <hi>Bleſſing was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,</hi> and <hi>life for evermore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now theſe are <hi>the Things which belong to our Peace,</hi> to be gathered under this wing of <hi>Truth:</hi> If we ſhould have all the world, and yet no <hi>Peace</hi> in it, what were we the better? And this we are called to, to know this <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent day of our Viſitation,</hi> leſt the Door be ſhut, and that which follows fall upon us, <hi>But now they are hid from thine eyes.</hi> O Lord! it makes my heart ſhake to think upon it, to have the Eyes ſhut, and cloſed up, to be left to grope, and wander, and ſtumble in darkneſs, and not to ſee when good cometh, and all for ſlipping the preſent opportunity, not <hi>knowing the things that belong to our Peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are yet two other Reaſons behind, why Chriſt weeps over <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, He weeps from an <hi>unſatisfied Love</hi> and <hi>Deſire</hi> after <hi>Ieruſalem: O that thou hadſt known, even Thou, in this thy Day,</hi> &amp;c. At length the fire breaks forth, and He can hold no longer, but muſt weep over His Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:169498:48"/>
                     <hi>Benjamin.</hi> But why <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> above all, that He weeps over Her, and cries out for her, <hi>O that Thou hadſt known?</hi> &amp;c. Why, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was the <hi>Beloved One,</hi> the <hi>choyce One of her Mother,</hi> born out of the <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Heart of God:</hi> Thou above all others; <hi>O that Thou hadſt harkened, then had thy Peace been as a River,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Chriſt weeps from the ſight of the <hi>miſerable</hi> and <hi>lamentable condition</hi> which he knows is coming upon them; not only ſhut out from the <hi>day of her mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> and <hi>the things that belong to her Peace; but now they are hid from thine eyes:</hi> and that is not all; but now God is departing, all <hi>woes</hi> and <hi>miſeries</hi> are coming upon Her. 1. <hi>Thine Enemies ſhall caſt a Trench about thee.</hi> And then, 2. <hi>Compaſs thee in on every ſide.</hi> And, 3. <hi>Shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee.</hi> And then, 4. <hi>Not leave in thee one ſtone upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> And then, 5. This added to all the reſt, Her own guilt, which brought all this evil upon her own head; <hi>Becauſe Thou knewest not the day of thy Viſitation.</hi> If all theſe Circumſtances and Aggravations were opened, and ſeized upon your hearts, it would appear a ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition indeed, and all for ſlipping the time, <hi>the day of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation.</hi>

                  <p>I Am daily and continually minding you, that you might underſtand the ſure <hi>principles</hi> and <hi>ground of Things,</hi> that you might know the Foundation and Cauſe whence all ſprings, in thoſe that are ſaved, and thoſe that are loſt. For whileſt we are judging according to appearance and effects, all is uncertain and doubtful, till we come to be <hi>unmoveably principled into the Foundation of all,</hi> how that ſtands. For Things are not as man judgeth; for it is not what man would; if he would be ſaved, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and ſtruggles to preſs in, alas, that is not the thing: <hi>It is not in him that wills, nor in him that runs.</hi> And then it is not what man would not; if he ſtands out, and oppoſes, and would never come in, yet if the word goes forth, <hi>Go and compel them,</hi> it muſt be done: It ſtands upon the <hi>Will of God;</hi> what He will, what He hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:169498:50"/>
and appointed, all muſt ſtoop to that; Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſubmits here.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I came not to do my own Will, but the Will of Him that ſent me, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Who this <hi>[I]</hi> ſpoke of, is. <hi>I came not,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>I,</hi> is the <hi>Son of God,</hi> the <hi>Mind of God,</hi> the <hi>Heart and Will of the Father brought forth;</hi> and this <hi>Mind</hi> of his He hath pleaſed to put into <hi>earthen veſſels,</hi> into his People in all days: This <hi>Son</hi> of his it was that ſpake in his Prophets, and opened the <hi>Counſel</hi> and <hi>Purpoſes</hi> of God to them; that which was hidden and layd up in his own Boſom from the foundations of the world, that is now made manifeſt by the appearance of Jeſus Chriſt, by this Boſom, and Heart, and Mind of his, ſent forth into his Prophets; that opened, and doth yet open, what was before the world began, and what ſhall be after that comes to an end: This opens the <hi>deep things of God. None knows the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son ſhall reveal him.</hi> There can be no coming near to God, no knowing, no being like him, unleſs this <hi>Son,</hi> this <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Heart</hi> be ſent out, and opened, and grow up in the Soul. Alas, the Deity in it ſelf is too large and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite for man to conceive of: If ever you come to have apprehenſions of the Godhead, it will drink and ſwallow you up: <hi>No man can ſee my face and live</hi> (ſaith God to <hi>Moſes,)</hi> therefore He hides him in the cleft of a Rock till his Glory paſs before him. Man is not able to come nigh that <hi>infinite Majeſty;</hi> and therefore He is pleaſed to ſend forth of Himſelf, His own <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Mind,</hi> His <hi>Son</hi> into his People: As He was once ſent out in the fleſh of Chriſt, our <hi>elder Brother;</hi> ſo is He now to be ſent into his People, the ſame Mind of God to grow up by degrees and degrees, as we are able to bear.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:169498:51"/>II. What is this Son of God, this Mind of His, ſent out to do? what comes it for?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I came not</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>to do my own Will, but the Will of Him that ſent me.</hi> It is a ſtrange Myſtery, (if you know not ſomewhat of it in your ſelves;) That this <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Mind</hi> of God that comes forth from God, and is God Himſelf, that yet this <hi>Son</hi> muſt not do his <hi>own Will,</hi> but <hi>the Will of the Father;</hi> that the <hi>Truth,</hi> and Chriſt Himſelf, though his deſires be juſt, and good, and right, yet He muſt not have them unleſs his Father pleaſe; His <hi>will</hi> muſt ſuffer, and be croſs'd, and denyed; therefore it is ſaid, <hi>He learn'd obedience by the things he ſuffered.</hi> It is ſtrange how God ſeems to contradict himſelf, that his own <hi>Heart,</hi> and <hi>Mind,</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> muſt yet be denyed, and ſuffer and ſubmit to do this <hi>Will of the Father,</hi> though it be againſt it ſelf; ſo great, and Lord-like, and commanding is this Will of the Lord our God. <hi>He doth</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) what ever pleaſeth him, both in Heaven and Earth:</hi> What ever he will do, that comes to paſs. If he bring ſome far on in the way to Life, that they come even to the door, yea into the very room; yet if he will then turn them out, and enquire, <hi>Friend, how cameſt thou hither without the wedding garment?</hi> The man is <hi>ſpeechleſs,</hi> and muſt be turned out preſently, if He will not have mercy, &amp;c. And on the other hand, if a man run never ſo far from him, with <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> into the bottom of Hell, that all ſeems utterly loſt; yet if he will recover, and bring back from thence, if He will have mercy, nothing ſhall hinder; ſo <hi>abſolute, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable,</hi> and <hi>over-ruling</hi> is this <hi>Will of the great Lord,</hi> without giving any <hi>account of his matters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And hence I would have you conſider three Things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What is the <hi>ground</hi> and <hi>foundation</hi> all the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and favour that we or any are ever like to enjoy;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:169498:51"/>
It muſt <hi>only be from this good-will of God:</hi> What he hath ſet and purpoſed for, or againſt, any, that ſhall ſtand. <hi>What ever his Soul deſires, that he doth,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job;</hi>) therefore he adds, <hi>When I conſider him, I am afraid of him.</hi> Have any of you this favour, to have a <hi>lot</hi> and <hi>portion</hi> in <hi>eternal life?</hi> It is his <hi>will</hi> that hath done it, his <hi>good-will,</hi> his <hi>good pleaſure,</hi> nothing can hinder it; If He will have mercy, who ſhall hinder? Again, are any left to deſtruction, to ruine and undo themſelves for ever? Alas, it is this <hi>Will</hi> that hath left them out, and <hi>deſtruction</hi> muſt then needs follow. What if God will harden <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and make ſome <hi>veſſels of wrath?</hi> If he will not ſhew mercy, who ſhall turn him?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As this <hi>will</hi> is the <hi>foundation</hi> of all that comes to paſs; ſo ſecondly, Conſider how <hi>reſolved</hi> it is, and all muſt buckle to it, even Things in Heaven and Earth, the Son himſelf muſt be ſubject; He comes down from Heaven, leaves his Crown and Glory, and muſt fulfil this <hi>Will</hi> by ſuffering: All things muſt ſtoop to this great Lord, ſo <hi>mighty</hi> is he, ſuch a <hi>Lord Paramount,</hi> ſo great a <hi>Ruler.</hi> Alas, Things come not to paſs according to mens thoughts and propoundings, but according to this <hi>Will of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Then Conſider, How this <hi>Will of God</hi> quite cuts off all our <hi>wils. Nothing that comes into your thoughts ſhall be at all,</hi> (ſaith God.) And again, <hi>Many are the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes of mans heart, but the Counſel of the Lord that ſhall ſtand.</hi> And He cries out againſt <hi>Jeruſalem, How long ſhall vain thoughts lodg within thee?</hi> All our thoughts are vain; if our <hi>thoughts</hi> are to <hi>ſave our ſelves,</hi> or if to <hi>condemn</hi> and <hi>undo our ſelves,</hi> they are all but <hi>vain: The Counſel of the Lord that ſhall ſtand;</hi> and the thing is done already before the foundations of the world were layd. When we have tryed all, and run out
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:169498:52"/>
all our runs, there is but one door to go to in all our needs, the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Purpoſe</hi> of God; and if we find no relief there, alas, the caſe is miſerable; man can never help himſelf: So that the great matter lies there, to know what that <hi>Will of God</hi> concerning us is, how that ſtands, what his thoughts are, and to be truly informed here, and layd ſubmitted to this <hi>Will;</hi> This is all we have to do, for the thing is done already. In the Salvation of them that are to be ſaved, how contrary are all things to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? how do they oppoſe and ſtand out more then any? <hi>Had the mighty works</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>been done in Sodom and Gomorrah, which were done in thee, they would have repented them in ſackcloth and aſhes:</hi> There would not have been ſo much oppoſition from them; but yet if he will ſave, he will ſave, nothing ſhall hinder. And ſo in thoſe that periſh, though they ſeek the bleſſing with tears, as <hi>Eſau</hi> did; though there be never ſo earneſt a crying, and weeping, and pleading, <hi>Lord open to us, we have caſt out Devils in thy Name,</hi> and <hi>Thou haſt taught in our ſtreets;</hi> yet all will not do, if his <hi>will</hi> be ſet once, and the doors ſhut, then <hi>Depart from me, I know you not,</hi> &amp;c. If we were but truly informed and principled in this thing, it would be a great ſetling to our minds. We have many ſtrange and vain wandring thoughts and troubles, for want of a true principling, and ſetting down here, that all muſt come to paſs according to this <hi>Will.</hi> Thou wilt perhaps ſay, But I have the <hi>Truth</hi> in me, and that cries, and deſires, and longs. Well, but the Son himſelf muſt be ſubject; the <hi>Truth in thee,</hi> the <hi>right deſires</hi> of thy Soul, muſt <hi>ſubmit to his pleaſure,</hi> whether to be <hi>anſwered</hi> or <hi>denyed.</hi> The Son himſelf ſays, <hi>Not my Will, but thy Will be done:</hi> And it is ſaid, <hi>He learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed obedience by the things he ſuffered.</hi> And if the <hi>Son of God,</hi> the <hi>Truth</hi> it ſelf, which comes out of his Boſom into
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:169498:52"/>
the world, into the man, if <hi>that</hi> cannot alter nor change his minde, but muſt ſubmit its Will to the Will of its <hi>Father;</hi> then ſure, <hi>the man,</hi> who is but <hi>duſt and aſhes,</hi> he can do nothing in it; his <hi>prayers</hi> and <hi>cries</hi> cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Will.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, what ever thy deſires are ſet upon, and how right and ſingle ſoever they may be; yet this is to be looked at in all; but, <hi>What is the Will of the Lord? what is his pleaſure?</hi> Chriſt, according to his tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>He would have all men ſaved, and come to the knowledg of the Truth:</hi> He deſired many things by his own Will, but He muſt come in again, and lay all thoſe deſires at his Fathers foot, and ſay, <hi>Yet not my Will, but Thine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now are any of you at a ſtrait and pinch, to know what ſhall become of you? Here the thing ſtands, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends onely upon this minde of God; and nothing (I know) can or will ever ſatisfie you, till that, which the <hi>Diſciples</hi> ask for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be granted you; <hi>Shew us the Father, and that will ſuffice.</hi> Chriſt had been long with them, tendering, exhorting, inſtructing, and bearing up their heads; yet that was not enough to them: they are at a want ſtill, till that word comes from Chriſt; <hi>And I ſay not, that I will pray for you; for the Father Himſelf loveth you:</hi> And this ſtays them indeed: <hi>Now ſpeakeſt thou plainly, and no Parable.</hi> This is more content and ſatisfaction, then all He had ever ſpoke before to them; this is the ground of all your Happineſs, if your Souls were but ſurely principled and ſetled in it. But then,</p>
                  <p n="3">III. What is this <hi>Will of the Father</hi> that He comes to do?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This is the Will of Him that ſent me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>that of all that the Father hath given me, I ſhould loſe

                  <p>And thus far I have gone, to ſhew you, who this <hi>He,</hi> ſpoke of, is; the <hi>heart,</hi> the <hi>minde</hi> of <hi>God</hi> ſent forth, tht <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> And, 2. What He was ſent out for; and that is, <hi>to do the Will of the Father,</hi> to ſubmit to <hi>that:</hi> And I told you how all ſtands in this Will of God; That if Chriſt Himſelf would ſave a man, yet He cannot do it without this Will of the Father: Therefore He ſubmits, <hi>Not my Will, but thine, &amp;c.</hi> Chriſt would <hi>that all ſhould be ſaved, and come to the knowledg of the Truth:</hi> but He muſt lay it down at his Fathers Will. And had I no more then my own <hi>deſires</hi> and <hi>love</hi> towards you to carry me forth, I ſhould ſurely have flagged and left you before this time; were not thoſe eternal thoughts of God, and that ſetled Will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning you, diſcovered to me. But now I come to open,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What this Will of God is.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And I told you there were two branches of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That a People were given to Chriſt by this Will of God: <hi>All that the Father hath given me,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt.) Now there is a threefold giving of a people to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He gives Him a <hi>people</hi> as his <hi>children,</hi> to be nurſed and tendred by him; and ſo He ſpeaks to his <hi>Diſciples</hi> ſeveral times, calling them <hi>children: Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, have you underſtood theſe things? &amp;c.</hi> They were but in the condition and ſtate of <hi>children,</hi> though they
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:169498:53"/>
were men. And here God puts Chriſt in the place of it Mother and Nurſe, to bring up thoſe that are thus given Him.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A <hi>Mother receives a ſeed from her Huſband,</hi> which is to be molded, and formed, and grow up in the womb, till it be a perfect child: ſuch a <hi>ſeed</hi> is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to warm and cheriſh, till it grow up to the minde of God, and have the true proportions of a child, and be like its Father: And therefore it is ſaid, <hi>The Promiſe is ſure to all the ſeed:</hi> And again, <hi>A ſeed ſhall ſerve Him, it ſhall be to the Lord for a genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. A <hi>Mother nurſes up her Children when they are born;</hi> ſhe feeds, and tends, and overſees them, till they are grown up to live of themſelves: And thus are a People given to <hi>Truth,</hi> that it may nouriſh, and care for, and deal tenderly, and lead them on, till they grow up to be <hi>ſtrong men</hi> in the <hi>Truth.</hi> How doth a <hi>Mother</hi> bear, and go through all with her <hi>child?</hi> all its <hi>frowardneſs,</hi> and <hi>croſſneſs,</hi> ſhe takes it up willingly. So this <hi>Love of Truth</hi> to its children; it is not eaſily provoked, it is not ſoon moved, but endures all things, and waies, and hopes all things: It ſpares from it ſelf to give to its children: ſuch a Nurſe is <hi>Truth,</hi> ſo tender and careful: <hi>I have been as a nurſe amongst you</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul.</hi>) If you perceive not this dealing of <hi>Truth</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, it is all but as a <hi>Riddle;</hi> If you are not ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, how tenderly and patiently you have been dealt with all along from your Cradles; nothing hard and unbearable hath ever been put upon you, but ſome iſſue hath been made for <hi>deliverance:</hi> You have been given into the <hi>care</hi> and <hi>nurſery</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> to look after, and provide for, you: nothing more is put upon you; but, <hi>open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it, &amp;c.</hi>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:169498:54"/>
There hath been one with you to care for you, when you have ſlept, and ſlighted, and not conſidered <hi>the day of your viſitation.</hi> You have little conſidered what it hath coſt to enjoy the <hi>breſts</hi> that you may ſuck at dayly; what a <hi>living Miniſtry</hi> you are entruſted with, and yet waits upon you: It reaches all that come neer it; none that have come amongſt us, have gone hence without the <hi>power</hi> of this <hi>Truth,</hi> convincing, and making them acknowledg, that <hi>of a truth God is amongst us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. God gives Chriſt a <hi>people</hi> as his <hi>Brethren,</hi> when they are grown up to that ſtate, as He calls the Church, <hi>My Sister, my Spouſe.</hi> And in being thus given to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> He manifeſts theſe three Things to the Soul.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He opens, that it is of the <hi>ſame ſtock and kindred with Himſelf;</hi> as it is ſaid, <hi>At the ſecond time</hi> Joſeph <hi>was made known to his Brethren.</hi> Now that the <hi>Soul of man</hi> and <hi>the Word of Life</hi> ſhould be ſo nigh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated as a <hi>Brother</hi> and <hi>Siſter,</hi> this is wonderful! It is too high to be expreſt by me, in words, or for you to conceive of: But yet there is a <hi>generation,</hi> a <hi>people,</hi> that ſhall juſtifie <hi>this wiſdom,</hi> that ſhall know <hi>this portion is befallen them,</hi> That they are of the ſame ſtock with the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> the <hi>Word of Life,</hi> That they are born from above; <hi>I am not of this world, and theſe are not of this world</hi> (ſaith Chriſt:) They are of one World, and one Kingdom, and one Country: Therefore he ſays, <hi>My ſheep hear my voyce, and the voyce of a ſtranger they will not hear; they know not the voyce of ſtrangers:</hi> They are not of that Country nor language, and ſo can underſtand no other language but the Word of Life. This is opened to the Soul, when it is thus given over to <hi>Christ,</hi> as a <hi>Siſter,</hi> one of the <hi>ſame ſtock,</hi> born from the <hi>ſame Love,</hi> as it is in <hi>Jeremy, I have loved thee of old with an everlaſting love, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:169498:54"/>2. <hi>Chriſt</hi> opens to the Soul, when it is thus given to him, the <hi>Priviledges</hi> it is to have with Him; That it is born to the ſame <hi>inheritance</hi> and <hi>portion</hi> that He himſelf hath: and without this, what is all <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> to you, if this <hi>portion</hi> be not made known as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to you? And none can read this <hi>ſeven-ſealed Book</hi> but the <hi>Word of Life:</hi> unleſs He read <hi>thy portion</hi> to thee, thou canſt never know it; unleſs He witneſs to thy Soul, as He did to his Diſciples, <hi>The Father Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf loveth you:</hi> And if he ever open this to you, it muſt be, when you are grown up to this ſtature, to be given him as a <hi>Siſter,</hi> as <hi>Brethren:</hi> For whileſt <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> and <hi>Babes,</hi> you have not underſtanding; you are not capable to know it, though it be never ſo often told you. O Lord, That you were at a ſtrait to have this opened! For <hi>your lives will ever hang in doubt,</hi> till this <hi>portion</hi> ſhall ſtabliſh, and ſettle, and put you out of all fears.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hence this follows, and is opened to the Soul, <hi>That it is now liable to be marryed to Chriſt, and become his Wife:</hi> It was a true Type among the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they were not <hi>to marry out of their own ſtock and kindred;</hi> All <hi>ſtrange wives</hi> were forbidden: So <hi>Chriſt marries not</hi> out of <hi>his own line,</hi> out of <hi>his own ſtock;</hi> He cannot joyn to the ſtock of the <hi>Devil:</hi> But ſuch as are his <hi>Siſter,</hi> born of one <hi>Father,</hi> ſprang from one <hi>Love,</hi> they may become a <hi>Wife</hi> for Him: Thoſe two links are joyned together in the <hi>Canticles, My Siſter, my Spouſe;</hi> but if no <hi>Siſter</hi> firſt, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be his <hi>Spouſe.</hi> I have told you often, <hi>gold</hi> and <hi>ſand</hi> cannot be run together into one lump: and it will ſurely grow up more manifeſt, that all <hi>relations,</hi> what ever, will dye, and come to nothing, where <hi>Truth</hi> lives in one party, if nothing of the ſame kinde
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:169498:55"/>
appears to maintain the tye in the other: A <hi>Huſband,</hi> a <hi>Wife,</hi> a <hi>Child,</hi> all theſe <hi>relations</hi> will dye, &amp;c. if there be not a <hi>ſurer bond</hi> to hold faſt for ever.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God gives a <hi>people</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as a <hi>ſpouſe, a wife given into his boſom.</hi> And here two things come in.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Serviceableneſs</hi> and <hi>ſubjection</hi> to the <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;</hi> That was the Law given at the <hi>Creation; Thy Deſire ſhall be ſubject to thy Huſband, and He ſhall rule over thee.</hi> Chriſt will now rule, and expects to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed; He puts the Soul upon ſervice now, it muſt no more be its own now, at its own hand and diſpoſing: <hi>The Wife muſt not pleaſe her ſelf, but her Huſband.</hi> If ever you come to be <hi>Chriſts Wife,</hi> you muſt do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for him: Do you look always to live as <hi>children,</hi> to be nurſed, and tendred, and fed, and never to do ſome ſervice for the <hi>Truth?</hi> &amp;c. And then,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If you come to be a <hi>Wife</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it will be expected you ſhould be <hi>fruitful,</hi> to bring forth <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> to keep the name of <hi>Truth</hi> alive after you: Will you onely leave <hi>a ſtone</hi> behinde you, like <hi>Abſalom,</hi> to keep up your names? Shall it be ſaid of you, <hi>Here a ſtony heart lies, that dyed without any ſervice done for the Truth; He hath left no children behind to ſpeak for him?</hi> Would you be content to dye in this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? and thus dye you muſt, if you never come to be marryed to Chriſt: you can have no <hi>true children</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>Huſband,</hi> if you be not given by God into his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, as his Wife. And thus I have opened to you one branch of this <hi>Will of the Father,</hi> in <hi>giving a people to his Son Chriſt,</hi> and that in a threefold relation: 1. In the relation of <hi>Children.</hi> 2. In the relation of a <hi>Siſter.</hi> 3. In the relation of a <hi>Wife.</hi> Which are but ſeveral ſteps
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:169498:55"/>
and degrees, according as the growing up of the <hi>Truth</hi> is, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another branch of this Will of God is, That <hi>Chriſt ſhould loſe none of thoſe that are thus given Him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this is the happy thing, <hi>to be given of God to Chriſt in any relation:</hi> If but His in the <hi>loweſt ſtation,</hi> if but as <hi>children,</hi> or if higher, given him as a <hi>Siſter,</hi> though not yet a <hi>Spouſe;</hi> yet this is the Happineſs, That <hi>this is the Will of the Father, that of all that He hath given me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>I ſhould loſe nothing:</hi> If but His in the loweſt degree, the caſe is happy: And therefore this is the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>weighty matter</hi> to be known, as the ground of all; Would you know what ſhall become of you? would you know whether you ſhall be loſt or not? Why, are you <hi>given to Chriſt,</hi> into <hi>his charge</hi> and <hi>care?</hi> do you know that? Are you his <hi>children?</hi> in the loweſt degree His? Elſe if you are not <hi>children,</hi> then you can be no <hi>heirs;</hi> you have no right nor porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Him: and if you be <hi>children,</hi> it will appear; the <hi>Truth</hi> will be ſtirring towards you, nurſing, and ſerving, and miniſtring to the Soul; dealing gently and tenderly, as a <hi>Nurſe</hi> or a <hi>Mother,</hi> that you may not <hi>be loſt, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About this two things were conſidered.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. What it is <hi>to be loſt?</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. How comes it, that <hi>All are not loſt?</hi> ſince all are <hi>Prodigals,</hi> and wander like the <hi>loſt ſheep,</hi> why not all loſt?</item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>What is it to be loſt?</hi> It hath theſe ſeveral things in it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>To be loſt,</hi> is, <hi>not to be of that ſtock and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred which the Lord Chriſt is ſent to gather:</hi> The great and main thing which is <hi>the cauſe of periſhing,</hi> is,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:169498:56"/>
                     <hi>the being left to a mans ſelf;</hi> That is enough to undo a man: <hi>Thy deſtruction is of thy ſelf (O Iſrael.)</hi> Men are already ſure enough in <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>deſtruction,</hi> if there be not a recovery, (were but the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of the thing upon them:) <hi>The carnal minde is enmity to God, and is not ſubject, neither can be, to his Will.</hi> And now to be but left here, not to <hi>be ſav'd out,</hi> ans <hi>pluck'd out of the fire;</hi> this is <hi>to be loſt:</hi> not to be of <hi>that number,</hi> not to be <hi>that loſt ſheep</hi> which Chriſt ſeeks up, as he ſays, <hi>Ye are not of my ſheep.</hi> And when ſome plead, <hi>Oh, open! we have eat and drunk in thy preſence, and thou hast taught in our ſtreets:</hi> yet He anſwers, <hi>I know you not, you are none of my ſheep;</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> gave me no charge over you, to ſeek and gather you; and therefore <hi>Depart from me.</hi> This is to be loſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>To be lost,</hi> is, <hi>to have the Gospel hid:</hi> If <hi>our Gospel be hid</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>it is hid to them that are lost, in whom the God of this world hath blinded their eyes, &amp;c.</hi> That is a token of a loſt condition, when the Soul is blinded, that there is neither a knowing of the Mercy, nor a knowing of the Judgment: <hi>I will ſing of mercy and of judgment</hi> (ſaith <hi>David.)</hi> Many they get up Goſpel-words, and ſpeak of Mercy, but they know it not: They can live looſely, and vainly, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and as they lift: But the Goſpel is for <hi>Judgment,</hi> as well as <hi>Mercy;</hi> That ſends a ſword: <hi>The Word of the Lord is quick and lively, more piercing then a two-edged ſword;</hi> It cuts, and divides, and ſquares, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: And if either of theſe be hid, either the <hi>Mercy,</hi> or the <hi>Judgment;</hi> if this <hi>Gospel</hi> be hid, it is <hi>hid to them that are lost.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>To be lost,</hi> is, <hi>to be given up to beleeve a lye,</hi> to be ſetled down to <hi>deceit,</hi> that nothing of <hi>Truth</hi> can ſeize, or enter: <hi>Charm the Charmer never ſo wiſely,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:169498:56"/>
yet the Ear is ſtopt: I'l hold my hold,</hi> ſays the heart: there is ſuch a <hi>ſecret reſolvedneſs</hi> in the Soul when it is given up <hi>to beleeve a lye:</hi> And this is <hi>to be loſt,</hi> to be left here to <hi>feed on aſhes,</hi> on any thing that is ſhort of a <hi>ſure condition;</hi> That which will not endure the <hi>fire,</hi> nor ſtand in <hi>the day of Tryal,</hi> though it may carry never ſo fair a ſhew before man. If man may judg, by his <hi>own wiſdom;</hi> of himſelf, He is the braveſt thing in the World; ſo long as he may beleeve his <hi>own thoughts,</hi> and feed on a <hi>lye;</hi> But if <hi>Truth</hi> comes indeed to ſearch and judg him, then he will be found the baſeſt thing in the World, the moſt vile and wretched.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>To be loſt,</hi> is, <hi>to be given up to an evil Eye;</hi> to think much at the proſpering of the <hi>Truth,</hi> and grudg all that is done to, and for, it; A <hi>Judas</hi>-like <hi>ſpirit,</hi> that grudged the <hi>ointment</hi> ſhould be ſpent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Christ,</hi> and thought it too good. This <hi>evil Eye</hi> to grudg at anothers enjoyment, this is a certain <hi>canker</hi> that will deſtroy us, if we are not delivered. It is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous thing to <hi>take offence,</hi> and <hi>dispute,</hi> and <hi>reaſon</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Truth; to ſpeak evil of the things we know not:</hi> And to be left to this <hi>evil Eye,</hi> to grudg, and think evil, and turn Traytor to <hi>Truth,</hi> is to be <hi>lost and undone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. A fifth thing that makes to a <hi>lost conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> is, <hi>to be left out of the care and heart of the people of God;</hi> to have none to look after the Soul, nor minde it: as the Curſe is in the <hi>Pſalms</hi> againſt <hi>Judas</hi> his children; <hi>Let there be none to take care of his fatherleſs children; let them be vagabonds, and beg their bread:</hi> And if there be not ſome to ſtand in the gap for you, you are in a miſerable caſe, to be left without the prayers of the Lord Jeſus in his people
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:169498:57"/>
for you; to be left out of the care and cries of that one <hi>Spirit;</hi> as the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>The Spirit it ſelf maketh interceſſion for us with ſighs and groans that cannot be uttered.</hi> Chriſt, and His <hi>Spirit,</hi> and His People, cannot be divided; He is with his Body, and that Body is but one, and the <hi>ſpirit</hi> that cries and groans in them is <hi>one Spirit:</hi> and if we have no ſhare nor portion in the care, and counſels, and prayers of his people; none to <hi>gather us into this Body;</hi> This is to be miſerable.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. To be left to a mans curſing, and rage, and deviliſhneſs of <hi>ſpirit;</hi> to be ſwallowed up and drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>the floods of ungodlineſs;</hi> and wholy transformed into <hi>the image of the Devil,</hi> and to be left here; This is to <hi>be loſt.</hi> And to this height will the leaſt ſeed of <hi>Sin</hi> grow at laſt, if Mercy be not ſhew'd to prevent from it. But this is <hi>Christs</hi> charge, and this is the <hi>happineſs</hi> and <hi>ſecurity</hi> of his People, That the Will of God ſtands in it, for the Salvation of his people: <hi>It is the Will of Him that ſent me, that of all which He hath given me, I ſhould loſe nothing, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now, if you come ſometimes, you may finde ſome of the <hi>ſaved ones,</hi> that are moſt dear to God, <hi>(Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to the Lord is the Death of his Saints,)</hi> yet theſe <hi>dear ones</hi> are ſometimes left to taſte of all theſe <hi>conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> You may finde them blinded, and given up to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve lyes; They are ſecure, and ſenſleſs; and in all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance they are ſunk in the mire as deep as any. <hi>Jonah,</hi> he cries, out of the bottom of Hell, <hi>I went down to the bottom of the Mountains; the Earth with her bars was about me for ever, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> cries out, <hi>I had almoſt ſaid as they; my foot had welnigh ſlipped.</hi> And ſo in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> He that followed the whoriſh woman, came to that paſs at laſt, to cry out, <hi>I was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in all evil,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.14. They come to the <hi>pits
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:169498:57"/>
brink;</hi> nay, <hi>David</hi> was in the <hi>pit,</hi> and therefore cries out, <hi>O let not the Pit ſhut her mouth upon me.</hi> How comes it about then that they are not quite loſt?</p>
                  <p>It ſtands upon theſe three grounds.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They cannot be quite loſt, becauſe the Will of God is ſet to ſave them: <hi>Their Safety and Security ſtands in that free and unchangeable Will. It is the Will of Him that ſent me, that of all He hath given me, I ſhould loſe nothing.</hi> And nothing can alter, nor turn his thoughts.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are nighly related to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and therefore cannot be loſt; they are his <hi>children: Behold, I, and the children God hath given me.</hi> And again: <hi>I ſaid of them, They are my people, Children that will not lye.</hi> And ſure He will not ſee his Children killed, and not riſe up to ſave them. Farther, They are his <hi>Brethren; He is not aſham'd to call them Brethren, Heb.</hi> 2.11. They are his <hi>Siſter,</hi> his <hi>Spouſe,</hi> that lies in his boſom, and He cannot bear to ſee them loſt: He is not able to ſee any of them in the Lions mouth, but he muſt reſcue them out, and ſlay the Lion: His bowels are turned to ſee them in miſery; and therefore <hi>He waits to be gracious.</hi> He ſtands pleading and entreating at their doors; <hi>O why will ye dye?</hi> Do you indeed hear? and do you conſider that this is the cauſe why you are not loſt and undone before this time? This is a wonderful myſtery, That ſuch a tye and neer relation ſhould be to the <hi>Word of Life,</hi> to the <hi>Lord</hi> Himſelf, that He ſhould take ſuch a care and charge over thee, and ſo wait and attend at all times to do thee good: It is from this neer relation to Him; <hi>He that ſanctifieth, and they that are ſanctified, are all of one:</hi> And this is the onely cauſe you are not loſt. And therefore what have any of you to boaſt on? Why are you not as baſe and vile as any? Why not loſt
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:169498:58"/>
as well as others? It is not any thing that ſprings from thee which makes the difference: We muſt all become guilty before God; we are the <hi>worſt of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:</hi> But becauſe He hath put his Son in you, and made you ſo nigh to <hi>Christ,</hi> therefore will He ſave you.</p>

Do you know you were ever given to any? into their hearts? <hi>to travel for you in the bowels of Chriſt?</hi> It is certain there are a <hi>loſt number</hi> that are not given to <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Now what <hi>ſecurity</hi> have you for your ſelves? Will <hi>that</hi> ſave you, that you have <hi>knowledg,</hi> and <hi>parts,</hi> and hear the <hi>Truth</hi> preached? Alaſs! many followed <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but at laſt came to a <hi>hard ſaying,</hi> and there they fell off, and left him: Therefore it concerns you to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, whether you have <hi>that</hi> which will carry you out, and give you a <hi>certainty</hi> you ſhall not periſh for ever? If you hear, and hear ten thouſand years, and hear not that you have a portion in this <hi>good-will,</hi> all is as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3ly, This may be of Uſe for encouragement, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort all the drooping hearts, that are ready to caſt off all, as if they were now quite loſt: <hi>Zion ſaid, The Lord hath forſaken me, &amp;c.</hi> No, no; there is no ſuch thing where his Will is once pitched: <hi>Having loved his own, he loved them to the end, Joh.</hi> 13.1. It is his Will, <hi>that none that He hath given to his Son ſhould be loſt:</hi> And therefore, however hard and dangerous the caſe ſeems at preſent, yet you that are given to this <hi>charge of Chriſt,</hi> and are under this Love, this might encourage you, That you have One that will look after you, and care for you: <hi>No man ever hated his own fleſh, but cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and nouriſheth it:</hi> ſo tender will <hi>Chriſt</hi> be to his <hi>own Body,</hi> if your lot be fallen in that good ground.</p>
                  <p>Therefore have <hi>your thoughts about you,</hi> and conſider the ground of your <hi>happineſs</hi> or <hi>miſery;</hi> Happineſs, if you be accepted in that <hi>good-will</hi> of the <hi>Father,</hi> and by that Will given to Chriſt to be his charge; this is a ſure token he wil ſave thee: Theſe are the <hi>two main pillars</hi> on

which your <hi>Salvation</hi> ſtands.

                  <p n="1">1. Theſe <hi>two ſons</hi> may be the <hi>Jew,</hi> and the <hi>Gentile,</hi> which once were in the Houſe together, in the days of <hi>Righteous Noah,</hi> when he built an Ark, to the ſaving of his houſhold: But <hi>Japhet</hi> the <hi>Gentile</hi> went out, and from hence came forth that Prayer, or Prophecy, <hi>God ſhall perſwade Japhet, and he ſhall dwell in the tents of Shem, Gen.</hi> 9.27. And now was the time of prevailing with him, (for at this time was the calling of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi>) but this <hi>younger ſon</hi> (the <hi>Gentile</hi>) would needs go from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Jericho,</hi> from the City of a <hi>bleſſing</hi> to a <hi>curſe:</hi> So is it with the heart, as the <hi>horſe ruſheth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the battel,</hi> without fear, and knows not but that a ſpear may ſtrike through his bowels; and as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>as the ſparks fly upwards;</hi> ſo natural is it for man to go to <hi>curſing.</hi> But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>A certain man had two ſons;</hi> a ſon that abode in the houſe, and a ſon that loves to wander: And this may have relation to a People joyn'd together in the <hi>Truth,</hi> being of one Family, as amongſt our ſelves; and yet we may wander one from another; we may not all of us ſo love our Fathers houſe, nor our Brethren, nor have a mind
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:169498:62"/>
to retain God in our counſels, but ſtand and ſeem <hi>wiſer in our own conceits then ſeven men that can give a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> But,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It may alſo have relation to the <hi>two ſons in one man:</hi> (For what ever we ſee in the great World with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us, the ſame is comprehended in one particular man, if it were diſcovered:) There are the <hi>two Nations in the womb,</hi> (as 'tis ſaid of <hi>Rebecca;</hi>) there's the <hi>natural</hi> ſon, and the <hi>ſpiritual</hi> ſon; there's the <hi>Jew,</hi> and the <hi>Gentile;</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi> is a natural branch, the <hi>Gentile</hi> contrary to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; the Son of God, and the ſon of man. <hi>Except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt.) A <hi>man, viz.</hi> the will, the underſtanding, the Soul, (for this houſe, the body that we carry about with us, that is not the <hi>man,</hi> where the Son of God dwells; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that hath not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his;</hi>) Now where that Spirit is, the Father brings that man to be his ſon, to a <hi>new birth;</hi> not to a new birth in the full ſence; for there's a two-fold birth; firſt, there's a birth to <hi>ſee the Kingdom,</hi> and then a birth to <hi>enter into the Kingdom of God:</hi> To the firſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal was brought. And this we can truly witneſs, <hi>We</hi> are born in the houſe, have <hi>eaten and drunk in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi> and <hi>heard him teach in our ſtreets;</hi> we have lived at his Table, we have had bread enough and to ſpare, having the <hi>world at will</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi>) &amp;c. But now we girded our ſelves (in this day) with <hi>Peter,</hi> we could walk upon the Sea to Chriſt, and thought our ſelves ſafe, &amp;c. till at laſt getting up our portion, we wandred from our fathers houſe. And this Interpretation I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to follow: For though the other two are true, yet if we come not to particulars, what's this to me? to hear of a <hi>Jew,</hi> and a <hi>Gentile</hi> without me; or to hear of a <hi>Prodigal</hi> wandring from his fathers houſe, &amp;c.

if all this while <hi>I</hi> be not this man, <hi>I</hi> this Prodigal ſpoke of? I ſhall now go on to the ſeveral <hi>Obſervations</hi> riſing from the carriage of this <hi>Prodigal ſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The ſon ſaid to his father,</hi> &amp;c. Hence is conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, the diſtinct knowing that God of his mercy hath brought him to, to know the <hi>Truth.</hi> It's not ſaid, that one ſaid, or that a certain man ſaid thus; but, <hi>the ſon ſaid to his father.</hi> And herein have we exceedingly made an evil of the goodneſs of the Lord: And it makes my heart tremble to think what want will come upon this <hi>Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> for it. But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing conſiderable in this <hi>Prodigal,</hi> is this; <hi>And the ſon ſaid to his father, Give me the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of goods that belongs to me.</hi> You ſhal ſee, if you mind it, another manner of carriage in him, when he returns from his <hi>Prodigality:</hi> Now he is upon his claiming, <hi>Give me my portion;</hi> but when he returns home, he does not ſay, (though greatly pined with hunger,) <hi>kill the fatted Calf;</hi> but he comes thus, <hi>I am not worthy to be called thy ſon, make me as one of thy hired ſervants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the days of our Ignorance, how do we <hi>claim our portions,</hi> looking for a reward as due to us? But no greater token that want is coming, then this; and this is a certain thing, that all our loſſes have come from this, and will come, whileſt you command God, and his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, ſaying, Why do'nt he regard me more? And ſo there is a claiming of our portions, and taking them out of the hands of <hi>Truth,</hi> and ſo we thruſt our ſelves out of the houſe, as the Prodigal, and ſay, <q>He will be ſuch a hard Maſter to me, I had better have it in my own hand.</q>
Thus hath there been an <hi>evil intreating of the Son of God:</hi> Now is that preſuming, and deſperate venturing, that we are able to go alone.</p>
                  <p>But I would you might read all along as you go, that

thoſe of you who are not fallen (if poſſible) might be warned; and if you are fallen, that you might learn In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction how to return. How did deſtruction come upon <hi>Korah</hi> for his evil reaching? <hi>What, are not all the Lords People holy? Will you put out the eyes of theſe men?</hi> But, <hi>by and by you ſhall know</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes:</hi>) And indeed how did they know to their woe? How did the fire of the Lord conſume ſome, and the Earth ſwallow up others? &amp;c. Oh that you might take warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing! But,</p>
                  <p n="3">3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. The father gives him his dereſi; a ſad caſe! <hi>And he divided to them his ſubstance.</hi> When <hi>Iſrael</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured againſt God, complaining of the <hi>light Manna,</hi> and craving for Quails, God heard their cries, <hi>He gave them their hearts luſt, but ſent them leanneſs of Soul.</hi> When I conſider the cries of our hearts, thoſe <hi>evil reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for the Truth,</hi> it makes my heart tremble, leſt God may take advantage in giving us our deſires: We think, becauſe we reach after the things of God, we do well; But when I think what <hi>Lot</hi> got by deſiring to go to <hi>Zoar,</hi> (though God gave him his choyce to go, yet) how did his <hi>heart reproach his mouth?</hi> When he had it, he could not abide there, but feared to dwell in <hi>Zoar; Zoar</hi> now will not maintain him; the time comes, when nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wiſdom, nor knowledg, nor diſcerning will ſerve the turn. <hi>Though I had the gift of Prophecy,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul,) and could underſtand all myſteries; If I had all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and faith, that I could remove mountains, it would profit me nothing, if I had not Love,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.2, 3. When I enjoyed the world at will, when my bough was green, when the dew lay upon my branch all night; then <hi>I ſaid in my prosperity, I ſhall never be moved; thou Lord of thy goodneſs hadſt made my mountain ſo ſtrong,</hi> (ſaith <hi>David.) I know thy works</hi> (ſaith the Angel to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:169498:63"/>
the Church of <hi>Epheſus) thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canſt not bear with them that are evil; and haſt tryed them which ſay they are Apoſtles, and are not, and haſt found them lyars,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Nevertheleſs, I have ſomewhat againſt thee, becauſe thou haſt left thy firſt Love:</hi> As if God ſhould ſay, <q>I know thy gifts have not ſprung from the garden of Nature, but I have given them, they were <hi>my Wool,</hi> and <hi>my Flax;</hi> but you have deck'd your Idols with them, therefore they are taken away.</q> But he gives a portion to his <hi>eldeſt ſon,</hi> that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall be taken away; He ſaith to him, <hi>Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine:</hi> But to the <hi>younger ſon</hi> he gives that which may be ſpent, the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Faith;</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> writes to <hi>Titus, Titus, my dear ſon</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>according to the Common Faith.</hi> But yet what a loſs came to the Prodigal, though truly a ſon? Such a loſs may the Soul come to, to be as naked as a child that is newly born. <hi>So fooliſh and ignorant was I</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) as a beaſt before thee. Behold</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>I make the Earth utterly empty, without an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant:</hi> And then (as Chriſt ſaid) <hi>you ſhall deſire to ſee one of the days of the Son of man, and ſhall not ſee them. As a dead man out of mind</hi> (ſaith <hi>David.</hi>) If we were aware of this, it would make us afraid of what we reach after. I know many of you have an aſpiring mind to be high, and accounted eminent in the Church; but if you would know for no better end then this, only to ſatisfie your reaching heart, if you employ not your <hi>Maſters goods</hi> to the beſt advantage, better had you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had the <hi>Truth,</hi> then to make an evil uſe of it; as <hi>Christ</hi> declares in the next Chapter, a Parable of a <hi>Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> that waſted his Maſters goods, and inrich'd himſelf by it. <hi>Ephraim is a fruitful Vine to himſelf:</hi> But (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith) <hi>Riches are given to ſome for their hurts.</hi>
                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:169498:64"/>
And here you may ſee, that if riches and honor, &amp;c. ſhall be the way to bring a man down, God will give him them. <hi>Eve</hi> ſhall eat of the Apple, though forbidden, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (ſaid ſhe) <hi>its good to make one wiſe,</hi> &amp;c.) that ſo ſhe might be brought under the curſe: Though all ſhall not have their hearts brought down that way; for ſome ſhall have their hearts diſcovered by their fooliſhneſs, they ſhall have no knowledg, but be ignorant, and brutiſh as a beaſt: What ſtrange ways does God take to bring down mans heart, before he can know that he <hi>ſtandeth by grace,</hi> that he is not able to think a good thought of himſelf? As the Prodigal here, as ſoon as ever he can get all together, he is gone, he thinks he is well now: As ſoon as God gives underſtanding, knowledg, diſcerning, then comes Pride, then we think we <hi>are ſomething,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we <hi>have ſomething:</hi> But alas (may we cry out as the man did to <hi>Elijah) it was but borrowed;</hi> and he that lent it, may call for it when it pleaſes him: Therefore <hi>let him that thinks he ſtandeth, take heed leſt he fall.</hi> How proud is this <hi>Peacock?</hi> how does ſhe ſpread out her tail? but when ſhe ſees her <hi>black feet,</hi> then ſhe hangs down her head.</p>
                  <p n="4">4<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. The Prodigal having <hi>gathered all together</hi> he has, then he goes forth gallantly adorned: Now <hi>I can give Reproof, Inſtruction, and Counſel</hi> (ſaith he;) and thus he looks upon his plume of Feathers: but by and by his portion is gone, his Feathers are pluckt, and then how naked and aſhamed is he? If you be made wiſe, to ſee and be warned, then happy are you: We never come to our loſſes, but by this prying upon our ſelves; (as the Apoſtle ſaith,) <hi>We meaſure our ſelves by our ſelves,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I am better then I was; and <hi>amongſt our ſelves,</hi> when we look upon others, we ſay, I am better then this and th'other; <hi>but in this you are not wiſe,</hi> &amp;c. But who of us
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:169498:64"/>
deſires the <hi>Truth</hi> as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>O deal kindly with me</hi> (ſaith he,) <hi>that I may keep thy Commandments?</hi> We ſay, Let me have the <hi>Truth;</hi> but for what end? to be proud of it? We often enquire and enquire, as the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes did of the blind man, <hi>But how came thine eyes open?</hi> as if we would be his Diſciples: But is it indeed for that end? I beſeech you enquire, why would you know the hidden Myſteries of God, and be of his Counſel? &amp;c. If you have no mind to be his Diſciples, there's great danger in it; there's great need to enquire wherefore you would know God: Would you <hi>know</hi> him, to <hi>fear</hi> him? fear him, to <hi>ſerve</hi> him? ſerve him, to <hi>love</hi> him? <hi>to love him, not your ſelves;</hi> is this in all your hearings, deſirings, and prayings? &amp;c. What would you have him for? is it to get honour to your ſelves? or is it for the honour of him? That in all your deſirings, this may be ſet before you, to ſay thus; <q>Did the Prodigal deſire? and did the father give him his deſire? But what did he with it?</q> He <hi>gathered all together,</hi> and ran from his father. We never undertake to be deſperately evil, but we firſt plot how to carry it out: As a <hi>thief</hi> that is reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſteal, he plots how to carry away what he intends to ſteal. When you look over, how you are wiſer, and have more diſcerning then others, how good is prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied concerning you, &amp;c. then you gather up your por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and arm your ſelves againſt the <hi>Truth</hi> to fight with it. All you that have gone far from God, have not gone naked; we have made uſe of what God had given us, to carry us out from him: We could never have gone into a Land of waſting, of hunger and famine, had we not once been in a Land of plenty; You have not gone out hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wink'd: How have you promiſed your ſelves, when you have gone into evil company, you would only go to learn experience, and return again preſently?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:169498:65"/>But whither have you carried your riches? even as the Prodigal, <hi>to a Citizen of that Country,</hi> where ſelf-love, pride, envy, &amp;c. dwells, where the <hi>Iſhmaelites</hi> dwell, the <hi>Tabernacles of Edom,</hi> of <hi>Moab,</hi> and <hi>the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garens, Gebal, and Ammon, and Amlaeck,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83.6, 7. All the kindred that are againſt <hi>Truth,</hi> Pride, Self-love, Envy, &amp;c. are the Country-men whither the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal carries his riches. And what doth he now do? does he go to God in this loſs? No, he joyns himſelf to <hi>this Citizen,</hi> one of the ſame kind; for ſuch as a mans heart is, ſuch is his ſociety he joyns himſelf to: If the heart is let out to Envy, then to the envious; if to Self-love, Pride, unmercifulneſs, it ſeeks for ſuch; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt our high thoughts come down: And whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of you ſhall be ſo wiſe to take warning by this, might be afraid to ask of God riches any more, ſince we have ſpent them upon our luſts. We have gone from <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> to that curſed <hi>Jericho,</hi> and as the Prodigal, ſpent all our ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And when he had ſpent all, there aroſe a mighty fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine in the Land, and he began to be in want,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo it will be; all the vertue, ſtrength, power, wiſdom, fear, love, &amp;c. what ever we have enjoyed that ſprung from <hi>Truth,</hi> will be ſpent, and the famine will ariſe.</p>
                  <p>But for what Cauſe?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As a juſt Judgment.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>David</hi> had numbered the people, God ſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him three Judgments, bidding him chooſe which he would: <hi>Shall ſeven years of famine come unto thy Land</hi> (ſaith God?) <hi>or wilt thou fly three moneths before thine enemies? or ſhall three days Peſtilence be in thy Land?</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.13. This was to come as a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon him: Therefore now in this ſtrait, what great need have you of one to <hi>make an attonement</hi> for you!
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:169498:65"/>
When you have had the exerciſe of <hi>Truth</hi> lively upon you, how have you babbled it to every one? You have thought, <hi>Sure I have riches enough;</hi> and ſo have run it out as long as ever you had breath; as a drunken man that has money, he ſpends all, never conſidering how hardly he came by it, and how ſoon he may want: Not like that wiſe man Chriſt ſpeaks of, who when he hath found the <hi>treaſure hid in a field,</hi> preſently goes and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it again, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.44. But as ſoon as we are a little brought out but to ſee our way, &amp;c. how do we tell it abroad to every one we meet? <hi>My heart ſhall never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach my mouth</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job,</hi>) I, but it did; for how did he curſe the day of his Being, &amp;c. though he had once ſpoke well of God? The Prodigal ſure once thought, when he was in his fathers houſe, that he ſhould never be ſo baſe as to leave his <hi>father,</hi> and joyn to a <hi>Citizen</hi> of a ſtrange Country; but you ſee he did it: But ſhall not God viſit for ſuch things as theſe? <hi>I will ſurely bring upon them</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>all the days of Baalim,</hi> when they offered ſacrifice to their Idols. God is a juſt God: <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> when <hi>Miriam</hi> was ſmitten, prayed, <hi>O Lord, let her not be as one dead; heal her now:</hi> No (ſaith God,) <hi>ſhe ſhall be ſhut out of the Camp ſeven days,</hi> till ſhe bear her ſhame; according to the tranſgreſſion of her Sabbaths when ſhe enjoyed them, ſo many Sabbaths ſhall ſhe be without a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> or an <hi>Ephod:</hi> Here's the Judgment indeed. God does not afflict willingly; but becauſe you would not hear, therefore He cries out, <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem! that ſtoneſt thy Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. He bewails over you, becauſe you have ſlept away your time, all the days of his patience, and long-ſuffering, and dayly calling upon you. It was poſſible to have turned his anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, while he was waiting, and enduring the froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and rebellions; but when he ſaw that <hi>Iſrael</hi> would
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:169498:66"/>
not for all this return, therefore (ſaith God) <hi>will I let go all my wrath.</hi> And yet be comforted in this, He is righteous in all his Judgments, and holy in all his ways; <hi>the miniſtration of condemnation is glorious:</hi> And now to <hi>accept of the puniſhment of iniquity,</hi> this God would have you do; for if we wring and wreſtle never ſo in the chain, he will be too hard for us. But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There ariſes a famine to this purpoſe, to ſhew us, there is no increaſe in this Land; we may carry much in, but bring nothing out again: <hi>Wo unto me</hi> (ſaid the Prophet,) <hi>that I am conſtrained to dwell with them that hate Peace.</hi> When we go into the Land of ſlanders, backbitings, envyings, &amp;c. theſe are not like the garden of <hi>Eden;</hi> A Land of plenty of all things is this Land, where <hi>Brethren dwell together in unity:</hi> But in this go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, the Lord will have <hi>no fellowſhip with the ſtool of iniquity:</hi> And though a man ſhould have a great ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and gather it all together, and carry it into a Land where nothing grows, it would ſoon waſte. They that go down to deſtruction, <hi>they cannot celebrate thy praiſe;</hi> there's nothing grows in that Land. You are wondering why you are ſo deſolate and empty, ſo voyd of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, &amp;c. alas, there grows nothing in this Land; you are gone out of the Land of plenty, and can it be expected that men can gather <hi>grapes of thorns,</hi> or <hi>figs of thiſtles?</hi> The time comes that all will be ſpent, and you ſhall won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the deſolation that ſhall come; you ſhall ſay, Where is the Land of Increaſe that once I was in? The Deeps they ſay, <hi>It is not in me;</hi> the Sea ſaith, <hi>It is not in me:</hi> But (ſaith <hi>Job,) Sure there is a place where Gold is found, and a vein for the Silver,</hi> Job 28.14. But as for the place of wiſdom and underſtanding, where is it? It's not in the wiſe world, it's not in ſleepineſs, nor envy, nor pride; where then? where the <hi>fear of the Lord</hi>
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:169498:66"/>
grows; they that fear the Lord, they are the men that get wiſdom. <hi>They have forſaken the Fountain of living water, and digged to themſelves Ciſterns that will hold no water.</hi> It's no wonder we are barren, becauſe we have not had the fear of the Lord before our eyes. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The famine ariſes for this Cauſe, that the Prodigal might be pincht out of his place. When a <hi>General</hi> of an Army goes to ſtorm a dangerous place, he firſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, May it not be taken by ſtarving them out, ſaith he? So the Lord deals with his <hi>Prodigals;</hi> they are gone far off from hearing, beleeving, &amp;c. but there comes a want, becauſe the Father intends to ſtarve them out. This mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery befell the ſon of <hi>Joſiah;</hi> he was carried into Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> being in chains, cryed unto the Lord, and becauſe he was of thoſe <hi>good Figs,</hi> God brought him out: But there is a miſery that befalls ſome, (as God bids the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> that he ſhould not weep nor pray for a people,) ſome go into Captivity, and ſhal return no more: But here's the mercy, God brought out his Prodigal, he <hi>was carried into Captivity for his good,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Land of famine, nakedneſs, &amp;c. to make him remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his fathers houſe; and where this want is, there's no greater token of deliverance. The <hi>reſtleſs Dove</hi> finds no footing, till ſhe return home to the Ark, whence ſhe went out; but the <hi>Raven</hi> went out, and returned no more: Some are brought into famine for their <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi> and ſome for their <hi>deſtruction.</hi> There were ſome invited to the feaſt, and becauſe they would not come, God ſwore, they ſhould never <hi>taſte of his Supper.</hi> But it was not ſo with <hi>Peter;</hi> he went a great way off, but the <hi>Cock</hi> did but crow, his Conſcience was awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Chriſt gave him but a look, and that broke his heart; for it was that <hi>look of Christ</hi> that was his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:169498:67"/>
though his Conſcience was awakened before. It was not ſo with <hi>Judas,</hi> he went out, but returned not again: And here lies th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>avour of them God intends good to, they ſhall return.</p>
                  <p>Therefore becauſe it hath been thus with us, that we are all Prodigals, and have gone out, and are in a very dangerous way, here lies the fear now, whether <hi>Truth</hi> will look upon us with an eye of favour or no: The <hi>Cock</hi> will of a certain crow, your Conſciences will be awakened, and your guilt will fly in your faces; but if that were all, our caſes would be the ſame with <hi>Judas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee the three Cauſes, why this famine is come: 1. As a Judgment: 2. To ſhew us, that no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement, no increaſe of <hi>Truth</hi> grows in that Country. 3. To pinch the Soul home to its Father; he muſt find <hi>no reſt,</hi> he muſt have <hi>no bread,</hi> he is glad to <hi>ſerve ſwine,</hi> and would fain <hi>eat husks</hi> with them, but muſt have none; and here's his mercy, that he has none. Here's the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; two Thieves are crucified with Chriſt, the one is <hi>ſaved,</hi> the other <hi>left.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore conſider, Though you are all ſinners toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you don't know whether you ſhall all return toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; therefore if the famine be come, the great thing is to know the end, whether there muſt be a return; for all comes but for this one end, that we might return home to our Father. <hi>And he began to be in want:</hi> The time will come, that the want will be <hi>felt,</hi> hunger that may be <hi>felt,</hi> a hard heart, a blinded mind that may be <hi>felt,</hi> then the want will come nigh. A <hi>mad man</hi> feels no want. Wh le we have been mad in our huntings after folly, &amp;c. we have not felt the want of <hi>Truth:</hi> But the time will come when we ſhall feel it; but why is he now in want? There is a two-fold want, and I would have
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:169498:67"/>
you diſtinguiſh them: There is a certain need when a mans <hi>head is plotting,</hi> yet there's a <hi>fainting of the heart,</hi> the dart ſtrikes him: how do we often <hi>famble</hi> in ſpeaking of our conditions? There's a want within, we want God; but we would carry it out fairly ſtill, ſhuffle it off, and ſay, as <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s ſervant did, <hi>Thy ſervant went no whither.</hi> When we have been rioting in an Harlots houſe, our heads are plotting, though we in want. Never would the Prodigal return, if poſſible, but that none would receive him when all is ſpent. How did <hi>Jacob</hi> change his wages ten times, becauſe he loved <hi>Labans</hi> ſervice? Before we will cry out, and own what we have done, how we have taken his Wool, and his Flax, and called them our portions, and ſpent them upon Harlots, it muſt be a want indeed.</p>
                  <p>But now is the Prodigal left to his laſt ſhift, and being once gone from his father, the heart is like a <hi>run-away child,</hi> though he can be received no where, yet he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lie in a ditch, or a ſtable, any out-houſe, then come and buckle to his <hi>father:</hi> Though he was in a Land of <hi>pits,</hi> and <hi>deſerts,</hi> of <hi>emptineſs,</hi> where no good grows, a Land of <hi>thorns,</hi> (therefore he came home ragged and torn;) yet for all this, his head is plotting ſtill to carry it out. Though <hi>Saul</hi> had forſaken the Lord, yet he comes to <hi>Samuel</hi> to ask counſel in his want, when the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins</hi> were upon him, &amp;c. Though <hi>Iſrael</hi> walk'd not ſtedfaſtly with God, but contemned the counſel of the moſt High, &amp;c. yet <hi>in their afflictions</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>they will ſeek me.</hi> The Prodigal joyn'd himſelf to a <hi>Citizen</hi> of that Country, not to a <hi>ſtranger,</hi> for then had it been poſſible, they might have gone out of this evil Country to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; but he is joyned to a <hi>Citizen,</hi> to <hi>the King of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> the Spirit of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> a dweller in that Land; and now to have him to be his Counſellor, that curſed <hi>Senſe</hi>

and <hi>Reaſon</hi> to rule all, to become one with that King of darkneſs, to be molded into that ſoil, O what miſery is it! <hi>Your League with Hell ſhall be broken, and your Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with Death ſhall be diſanulled:</hi> But as yet it is not broken in us; there has not been a <hi>tranſlation out of the Kingdom of Darkneſs into the Kingdom of Light:</hi> We can truly ſay, we have been born again, and have ſeen the Kingdom; but <hi>Except a man be born of Water and the Spirit</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>he cannot enter;</hi> that <hi>birth</hi> has not been: Therefore what fellowſhip and ſociety has the Prodigal? why ſuch as is ſuitable to him: for now the heart is afraid of the righteous, the clean and juſt ones; now it invents, ſaying, <hi>How ſhall I ſpend my days?</hi> &amp;c. And now he is joyned to the <hi>Citizen,</hi> he muſt do his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and whats that? he muſt now be a <hi>ſerver of ſwine;</hi> Alas, alas! what a caſe is he in! <hi>Now Princes go on foot</hi> (indeed,) <hi>and ſervants ride on horſes:</hi> What, for a Prince to feed ſwine!

                  </p>
                  <p>But here was his mercy, that he had no mercy ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; and this was a token God would bring him out, becauſe the hearts of them he would have had fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from, were cloſed to him. If indeed God has a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to a man that is intangled in the world, and will bring him out, he will let him find <hi>no favour.</hi> When God had a purpoſe to bring <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt, he turned the hearts of the Egyptians to hate them.</hi> But

                  <p>
                     <hi>I ſhall ſpeak next of his Return, and then of his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment by his father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By and by he <hi>comes to himſelf,</hi> and now he ſays, <hi>How many hired ſervants in my fathers houſe have bread e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough and to ſpare, and I pine with hunger?</hi> But where had he been? Why, all this while he was <hi>out of his wits,</hi> he was <hi>not himſelf,</hi> he was <hi>enchanted;</hi> But when he came to conſider what he once enjoyed, and the preſent miſery he was in, <hi>Alaſs!</hi> (as if he ſhould ſay) <hi>what a caſe am I in? I, that am a ſon, who have a father, &amp;c.</hi> He remembers the time that he was brought forth by the <hi>Truth,</hi> and truly born to be a <hi>Child:</hi> He is not now as one that knows not who he belongs to, and is not able to go to a <hi>father;</hi> but he knows him: And if this be not in your returning, you will never return.</p>
                  <p>Two Conſiderations there are muſt move you to it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To conſider that you <hi>are children;</hi> for if you know not this, you will never return: <hi>He that comes to God muſt firſt beleeve that He is,</hi> before he can ſet one ſtep to come to him: <hi>Turn to your ſtrong holds, you priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of hope.</hi> But while you ſtand diſputing, <hi>Am I a ſon or not? &amp;c.</hi> here you have forgotten that you were once cleanſed, that God is your <hi>Father;</hi> but when once you ſhall come to your ſelves, you will then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, and ſay, <hi>Thou art our Father, we are thy Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi> The way to come to the bleſſing of the <hi>Birth-right,</hi>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:169498:69"/>
is, to ſet an high price upon it, not to diſ-eſteem it, and count it light (as <hi>Eſau,</hi>) for therefore he loſt it. Now though you have ſpent your portion, and loſt it, and ſquandred it away you know not how; yet there's hope: but if you had <hi>despiſed</hi> it, and trod it under foot as a light thing, then had there been no hope; but (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) <hi>Brethren, I know that through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance you have done it:</hi> You have gone out with this Saying, That ſure you are well, it will maintain you, &amp;c. But No, it was not given for that end. I beſeech you conſider, that you be not of them that draw back to perdition; I know you have not ſo properly been there in deſpiſing, but here you have been, <hi>You have left your firſt Love:</hi> If there had been a contemning your <hi>Birth-right,</hi> and ſaying as the man that had but one Talent, <hi>What's this? &amp;c.</hi> if a deſpiſing, then had there been no return: but you have been cheated of your por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the ſubtle Enemy has got beyond you; all that you have cared for has been, that you might have meat for your luſts; as <hi>Eve,</hi> ſhe did not ſell her <hi>birth-right,</hi> but <hi>the ſerpent beguiled her, and ſhe did eat.</hi> If indeed there is to be a return in you, I beſeech you conſider; (for it's in vain to think of returning, if no <hi>fathers houſe</hi>) if thou wert never born to <hi>ſee the Kingdom,</hi> there can never be an <hi>entering</hi> in.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This encourages him in his Return, when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders with himſelf thus, <hi>How many hired ſervants in my fathers houſe have bread enough and to ſpare?</hi> Who have no <hi>portion,</hi> they have been followed, and dandled upon the knee; but I, being a <hi>ſon,</hi> have been cheated of my portion. How are you made to cry out ſometimes, <hi>Woe is me, for the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherouſly with me!</hi> You have been enchanted, your iniquities have hindred good things from you; but when
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:169498:69"/>
he conſiders theſe two things, then he ſays, <hi>I will ariſe and go to my father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this is beyond all that went before; for while he was under the judgment, under the plague, pinched with want, yet this makes him not ariſe; but now he ſaith, <hi>I will ariſe and go,</hi> when he conſiders he is a <hi>ſon,</hi> and that he is worſe then any <hi>hired ſervant</hi> in his <hi>fathers houſe</hi> that hath no portion. Oh that the Lord would be pleaſed to call you <hi>according to purpoſe,</hi> that you might have no reſt till you return. When <hi>Jacob ſaw the charets</hi> that were ſent from <hi>Joſeph</hi> (he could not beleeve, for all the former reports, but his heart fainted ſtill; yet now) <hi>the ſpirit of old Jacob revived, Geneſ.</hi> 45, 27, 28. He reſolves, <hi>I will ariſe and go,</hi> what ever it coſt me.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>this ariſing of the Prodigal</hi> theſe things are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He is made ſenſible of the want he is in; that there's neither bread, nor clothing, nothing that's good where he is; therefore he ſaith, Well, <hi>I will ariſe and go to my father,</hi> for there the ſervants have bread e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, &amp;c. much more I that am a ſon, might: Now he bethinks himſelf where he is, how beſet on every ſide. And here conſider, what a ſtubbornneſs there is in man, an evil malignity againſt God: for we may ſay, Why cannot he return without this ſtir? Why, becauſe of that evil-diſpoſedneſs in the heart that would not love the Lord: Why? <hi>What evil have I done</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>to you, that you would none of me? Have I been a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs or a land of darkneſs to Iſrael?</hi> No; all ariſes from an <hi>evil will</hi> that lieth in the bottom, and is at en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with God: But when the Soul is brought to ſuch a pinch, that there's no remedy, (for God will never leave hunting and hunting (as a <hi>blood-hound</hi>) till he findes out its iniquity;) then the Soul is made at laſt to ſay as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:169498:70"/>
Whither ſhall I fly from thy preſence? If I take the wings of the morning, and fly up to Heaven, thou art there; if I go down to Hell, there will thy hand find me out, &amp;c.</hi> At laſt, when pinched out of all, and no other ſhift, <hi>I will ariſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and go to my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2ly, <hi>I will ariſe, &amp;c.</hi> As though he ſhould ſay, <q>Well, againſt all my fears and gainſayings, &amp;c. I will ariſe, what ever I ſhall meet with; I will forget all my ſhame, all my ill dealing, &amp;c. nothing ſhall ſtand in my way to hinder, now there's a going as <hi>Benhadads</hi> ſervants with <hi>ropes about their necks;</hi>
                     </q> and as <hi>Eſther,</hi> though it was death for any to go in before the King, yet (in ſuch a caſe of neceſſity) ſhe is reſolved to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and goes thus, <hi>If I periſh, I periſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O all you Prodigals, that have gone aſtray from your fathers houſe, &amp;c. when will you venture into the hands of Juſtice (as the <hi>Prodigal</hi> here) and ſay, <hi>I will ariſe?</hi> We are like a man that ſtands betwixt hope and fear, that would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When you ſhall conſider and ſay, <hi>Why ſhould I not hope? Is he not my father? If we ſit here</hi> (ſaid the <hi>Lepers) we periſh; and if we ariſe and go upon our Enemies, we can but dye;</hi> Need forces them at laſt: So here (ſaith the Prodigal) <hi>I will ariſe;</hi> ſee, prove him, if he will not open the windows of Heaven to you, and receive you. But,</p>
                  <p n="3">3ly, Does he take off his filthy garments when he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes? No; but though he be naked and deſolate, yet, <hi>I will ariſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and go to my father, and ſay, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I have ſinned, &amp;c.</hi> He does not lay his grievings of his Father aſide, how ill he has delt with him, but <hi>that</hi> he

carries on his back: When ever your Souls ſhall ariſe, think not to leave your iniquity behinde you, and come clear; but come as you are, owning and confeſſing the thing as it is, ſaying, <q>I once lived nigh <hi>thee,</hi> in the houſe, in the counſel; but I thought it not good to keep there, but have choſen rather to wander from <hi>thee:</hi>
                     </q> 
                     <hi>I have ſinned againſt Heaven</hi> (thy people) <hi>and before thee, &amp;c.</hi> For now, being once born again, and turning out, we defile not only our ſelves by our ſin, but one another, either by our evil counſel, or not ſtanding, or not helping others to ſtand; yet thus he ariſes and goes to his father; he bears his ſin, and ſight of it, he goes as he is.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And when his father ſaw him a great way off, he ran and met him, and fell upon his neck and kiſſed him: And the ſon ſaid, Father, I have ſinned againſt Heaven, and in thy ſight, and am no more worthy to be called thy ſon: Make me as one of thy hired ſervants.</hi> Here appears the pride of our hearts; we would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with <hi>a morſel of bread:</hi> But when the father ſaw him <hi>a great way off,</hi> [ſaw his mind coming] he ran and met him; He <hi>waits to be gracious:</hi> And, <hi>If any man ſay, I have ſinned, and perverted that which was right, and it did not profit me; then he will deliver his Soul from death, &amp;c. Job</hi> 33.27, 28.</p>
                  <p>But now conſider, If you ſhould lie owning and confeſſing all your life-time, and ſhould not ſtir in your ownings, there would be no meeting of you; there's a certain <hi>ſavoring</hi> of a <hi>returning minde:</hi> but while he was feeding ſwine, and pined with hunger, he might have ſaid, <hi>Sure my father will look for me, he will not leave me:</hi> No, no; there's no looking after him, ſo long as he is loving to feed ſwine: No, ſaith God, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim is joyned to Idols, let him alone.</hi>

                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:169498:71"/>Therefore <hi>all you Prodigals</hi> think upon this; <hi>Truth</hi> does not regard you while you love darkneſs rather then light: but as ſoon as the <hi>Prodigal</hi> does but return, then ſaith the <hi>father, Come bring the best robe and put it on him, &amp;c.</hi> But did he think to finde ſuch entertainment as this?

                  <p>Here will be conſidered the order next, And why not meat for his belly firſt? for he was now almoſt ſtarved by reaſon of famine: Yet (ſaith the father) in the firſt place, <hi>Come bring the beſt robe.</hi> Wherein you may conſider theſe three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The beſt robe is brought to <hi>cover his nakedneſs,</hi> for there's no ſtanding elſe before God; there's no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting with him at all except <hi>the ſin</hi> be covered: while there's any guilt upon the heart, there cannot be a neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs betwixt God and man. But in all reaſon he ſhould have had meat for his belly firſt; yet that muſt not be till he has <hi>the beſt robe,</hi> [the Fathers beſt Love upon his back;] becauſe there can be no ſtanding in his ſight to ſpeak a word without it: For <hi>who can ſtand before everlasting burning?</hi> And <hi>God is a conſuming fire.</hi> Where this Love is not firſt a covering, they will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                     <hi>cry to the rocks and the mountains to fall on them;</hi> for who can ſtand before God in his guilt? Therefore firſt this is moſt needful, to be covered with the <hi>best robe.</hi> But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Bring the beſt robe,</hi> becauſe <hi>the ſinner ſtands with ſuch a ſhame upon him:</hi> for while he ſtands guilty, there can be no boldneſs nor freeneſs to receive any thing from his Father. The poor ſinner ſaith, <q>I know not why he gives me this and th'other; for ought I know it's for my greater condemnation:</q> for (as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſaith) <hi>Some have riches given them for their hurt:</hi> And how many patterns do we ſee of it!</p>
                  <p n="3">3.

It's ſaid of <hi>Elkanah,</hi> he gave por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to all his wives, but to <hi>Hannah he gave a worthy portion,</hi> becauſe he loved her. <hi>I have loved thee with an everlasting Love</hi> (ſaith God,) <hi>therefore with loving kindneſs have I drawn thee,</hi> That <hi>where ſin abounded, Grace might ſuperabound;</hi> for yet in the worſt day the Soul is made to ſay, <hi>but my wiſdom remained with me.</hi> The <hi>Prodigal</hi> in the worſt day retained his <hi>ſonſhip</hi> ſtill, though when he returns he is made to confeſs the thing as it is. But firſt he ariſes, and that's beyond all <hi>that howl upon their beds;</hi> In their ſickneſs-time and ſtraits they will cry out, <hi>Oh, what a wretch am I!</hi> but their iniquities are ſtill upon their backs; they ariſe not, they dare not approach before God: But the <hi>Prodigal,</hi> though he comes <hi>bowing</hi> and <hi>bluſhing,</hi> yet he comes <hi>knowing</hi> and <hi>hoping;</hi> and he never ſays that word, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> I <hi>have ſinned,</hi> but the Father ſaith preſently, <hi>Bring the beſt robe.</hi> But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I told you this was conſiderable the <hi>Father</hi> ſaith, <hi>And put a Ring on his hand:</hi> Do you conſider what Rings are uſed for? They are not put on to ſtrengthen the hands, but to adorn them: But <hi>what is the hand for?</hi> It's for work: <hi>O prosper thou the work of our hands</hi> (ſaith <hi>David.</hi>) Now what muſt the <hi>hand,</hi> the <hi>work</hi> be adorned with? There are theſe three ornaments for it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Prodigal</hi> muſt be adorned with <hi>Skill;</hi> as it's ſaid of <hi>David</hi> concerning <hi>Iſrael, He fed them in the integrity of his heart, and guided them with the skilfulneſs of his hand, Pſal.</hi> 78.72. It has taught the <hi>Prodigal</hi> skill indeed; he can ſay now as <hi>David, Come <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>y Brethren, and</hi> I <hi>can tell you what God has done for
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:169498:73"/>
my Soul;</hi> how he delivered me, and inſtructed me; now I am made able to <hi>divide the word aright:</hi> There's great need of skill to know <hi>when</hi> to ſpeak, <hi>how</hi> to ſpeak, <hi>to what</hi> to ſpeak, <hi>for what purpoſe</hi> to ſpeak, either for <hi>edification</hi> or <hi>deſtruction.</hi> All the while before he had no heart to <hi>pity ſtrangers,</hi> till he was <hi>fallen amongst thieves, &amp;c.</hi> and now after his coming home, he is able to inſtruct and teach others; If <hi>there be a meſſenger, one of a thouſand, to ſhew unto man his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, &amp;c.</hi> Now he has learnt expereince by his wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But all the while we were in the houſe, we were <hi>Novices;</hi> we had learn'd no skill how to inſtruct o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for we had learn'd none our ſelves. But now <hi>the burnt child dreads the fire;</hi> when we have run our rounds, tryed what is in <hi>madneſs</hi> and <hi>folly,</hi> it brings forth <hi>skill:</hi> And who are fit to bring up a people in the <hi>wiſdom and fear of the Lord,</hi> but ſuch as have <hi>gone down to the deeps,</hi> as <hi>Joſeph</hi> did? Firſt he had been proved and tryed himſelf; he was <hi>ſeparated from his brethren,</hi> as Chriſt ſaid of <hi>Peter, Satan hath deſired to ſift thee,</hi> and he ſhall, &amp;c. <hi>but when thou art converted,</hi> then <hi>ſtrengthen thy brethren.</hi> But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing the hand is to be adorned with, is, <hi>Diligence;</hi> being now once brought from his <hi>prodigality,</hi> he will <hi>redeem the time,</hi> and be more watchful and diligent then ever: <hi>Be you vigilant, for your Enemy the Devil goes about like a roaring Lion, ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi> It's an ornament to the work when it goes on with diligence, not ſleepingly: we ſay of ſuch a man, ſure the work is never like to come to perfection. The Lord expects a <hi>diligent hand</hi> in all your ſervices, and that beautifies the work; but to beautifie a <hi>ſlothful hand,</hi> is like to the putting <hi>a Ring in a ſwines ſnout:</hi> He <hi>will not reward the ſlothful hand,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:169498:74"/>
but the diligent he rewardeth:</hi> The Soul, <hi>that</hi> is dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent night and day, how to further the work of the Lord; therefore <hi>Be you always abounding in the work of the Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul,) knowing that your labor is not in vain, &amp;c.</hi> But alaſs! while we are in the Land of Harlots, we are aſhamed of our work. A man that has no <hi>meat</hi> to eat, nor <hi>clothes</hi> to put on, nor a <hi>friend</hi> to go to, to impart his grief, what a miſerable caſe is he in! ſuch a Land are you in, where there's no growing of any thing that good is; nothing but <hi>leanneſs</hi> and <hi>ill-favored<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> becauſe you have outed your ſelves of all friends: But when you ſhall be brought home, then will you ſay, Well, I <hi>will be diligent:</hi> Then will you ſet an high price upon the <hi>Truth,</hi> and ſay as <hi>David, O what ſhall</hi> I <hi>render to the Lord? &amp;c.</hi> I know how many precious days and ſeaſons you have troden under foot, but the time will come that you will be glad to glean them up again, and ſay, I will be more diligent to hear, and lay up every word, and Look: The leaſt ſmile of <hi>Truth</hi> will be layd up; every Mercy will you be made to prize: There will be no more a claiming, (as the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,) <hi>Give me my portion;</hi> and ſaying to me, <hi>You are bound to preach,</hi> and look after me, and give me this and th'other: No, there will be a diligent hand prizing and improving to the utmoſt the leaſt mercy. But,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third Ring that adorns his hand, is, the <hi>weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs of employment,</hi> when the hand ſhall be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in things of great concernment: When we paſs and ſee a man at work in carving ſome curious piece, and not buſied upon baubles and trifles (like children that make dirt-pyes) we ſtand and prize the work: This will adorn the hand, when it ſhall be employed about <hi>things that profit,</hi> to be about a work which ſhall <hi>abide for ever; Let all your words be full of grace, ſeaſoned
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:169498:74"/>
with ſalt.</hi> To be employed about ſuch a work, which neither fire nor water can hurt, this adorns the hand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: But alaſs! what a little of our work will endure the fire? but we ſhall know the difference. I ſhrink to think what I ſhall ſay: <hi>But must you all go a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galling? Will you all ſee your hearts by desperate ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turings?</hi> Indeed Travellers learn experience, but they pay dear for it: None will know how to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween works and works, but they that have traded through them. <hi>When</hi> I <hi>was a child</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) I <hi>did as a child, and ſpoke as a child; but when</hi> I <hi>became a man,</hi> I <hi>put away childiſh things.</hi> The Prodigal did fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhly in forſaking his Fathers houſe, and going to Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots, &amp;c. but God ſhall ſay to him at his return, <hi>Be not grieved that you ſold me, &amp;c.</hi> He has loſt nothing by it, he is made now to love him the more: When God ſhall ſay, <hi>'Twas not you that ſold me, &amp;c.</hi> 'I ſent you into the wilderneſs to learn you experience, that when you are converted, you might ſtrengthen your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
                  <p>Thus you may ſee of what uſe Rings are: and this is wonderful, that God ſhould ſo adorn the hand with his Rings; To be, 1. Skill'd in the works of <hi>Truth.</hi> 2. To be diligent in the work of <hi>Truth.</hi> And, 3. To be gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with this, to be buſied about things of worth, to be exerciſed in things that abide for ever: <hi>Let all your things</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) be done to edification:</hi> Let nothing be out of ſtrife or vain glory, but all for the building of ſomething that ſhall ſtand for ever. But yet this ſon is wanting ſtill; as if the <hi>Father</hi> ſhould ſay, <q>What if we clothe him with the <hi>beſt robe,</hi> and put <hi>Rings</hi> on his hands;</q> yet if his feet be not ſhod too, how can he go? Therefore,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This is the third thing, <hi>And put ſhooes on his
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:169498:75"/>
feet, &amp;c.</hi> Let him be <hi>ſhod with the Preparation of the Everlasting Gospel of Peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The feet are the Affections,</hi> which are to be wrought upon.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To go, but how? why, <hi>Let all your things</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) be done in Love:</hi> There's need your feet be prepared to ſerve the Lord <hi>in Love:</hi> And that our loves might be prepared, there's need of <hi>ſhooes</hi> to put on, that the feet might be enabled to go upon the bryars and thorns, to endure the froſt and the ſnow; need to have the Love made ſtrong, to endure hardneſs: <hi>Love</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) ſuffereth long, and is kinde, envyeth not, ſeeketh not her own, is not eaſily provoked, thinketh no evil, rejoyceth not in iniquity, but rejoyceth in the Truth,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4, 5, 6. It had need be ſhod in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
                  <p>When God ſaid to <hi>Moſes, Thou ſhalt carry this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in thy boſom as a Mother doth her child, &amp;c.</hi> Alaſs, (pleads he) <hi>how can</hi> I <hi>carry all this people?</hi> If <hi>thou dealeſt thus with me,</hi> I <hi>pray thee take me away, that</hi> I <hi>may not ſee my wretchedneſs:</hi> He had not <hi>Love</hi> enough to carry him through; There's need of great preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if ſuch a ſervice be in hand. And now the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal ſhall be made to <hi>endure,</hi> to bleſs when he is curſed, becauſe he knows now the heart of a ſtranger: <hi>We our ſelves</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) were ſometimes ſtrangers and ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens from the Commonwealth of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>hateful, and hating one another:</hi> He having a knowledg into this, was made to endure, <hi>Though the more abundantly</hi> I <hi>love</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the leſs</hi> I <hi>be loved.</hi> That there may not be a ſhrinking here, this is one main thing he has need of, of the <hi>ſhooes,</hi> of that which may be a fence, a ſafeguard to his feet; that no fiery darts; no diſcontents, &amp;c. may ſtop or overturn him. But then,</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:169498:75"/>2. The <hi>ſhooes</hi> are, that the Love might run the ſwifter, without fear: <hi>Withhold thy Feet from being <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NSHOD</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>and thy throat from thirſt,</hi> Jerem. 2.25. <hi>Thou makeſt my Feet like HINDES FEET</hi> (ſaith <hi>David:</hi>) But when the Love is cold, then the heart by and by waxeth feeble and faint. <hi>Ezra</hi> was aſtoniſh'd, and ſat ſeven days ſo, becauſe he had ſaid, <hi>The Lord was able to ſave them;</hi> therefore (ſaid he) I <hi>was aſhamed to go to the King for a band of men:</hi> His Love began to be feeble at laſt. And <hi>Job</hi> ſat aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd ſeven days; his Love was cold; he could not have offended, had that been alive: <hi>Great Peace have they that love thy Law, and nothing can offend them.</hi> How do we ſtand, and pick and chooſe? But when we ſhall be made able to ſay as <hi>Paul,</hi> I <hi>am not onely ready to be bound for the Name of Chriſt, but to ſuffer death alſo;</hi> When ſo ſhod, then ſhall we go boldly without fear: when the Love is ſhod with <hi>quickneſs,</hi> then, I <hi>ſhall run the way of thy Commands: When thou haſt ſet my feet at liberty</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi>) then will the Soul readily love the Lord <hi>with all the heart,</hi> and <hi>all the ſoul,</hi> and <hi>all its ſtrength.</hi> But when it's not quick and lively, there come in the miſcarriages. For, 1. It's not ſhod to endure: And, 2ly, then it has not quickneſs to ſpeed on the work; but through reaſoning and diſputing the caſe, the Love waxes cold: And the Prodigal ſhall be made to ſee, to his coſt, when he returns home, what his <hi>Leaden-heel'd Love</hi> was. But,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third thing that prepares the Love, is, <hi>ſingleneſs, ſolidneſs, and faithfulneſs;</hi> theſe are <hi>the ſhooes</hi> that garniſh his feet; theſe are <hi>the Affections</hi> to be ſhod with: <hi>The double minded man</hi> (ſaith <hi>James) is unſtable in all his ways.</hi> When the Prodigal comes home, and ſees how double he had been before in all his
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:169498:76"/>
ways, now he is made to ſay, <hi>It was good for me that I was afflicted, for thereby I learn'd thy Law:</hi> Now he can ſay, <hi>One thing have I deſired, which</hi> (now) <hi>I will ſeek after, That I may dwell in the houſe of the Lord for ever, to enquire dayly in his Temple, &amp;c.</hi> Now the Prodigal has learn'd this, He knows what it is <hi>to put his hand to the plow, looking backwards:</hi> Now his Love is ſingly fixt upon its object; but when it was not ſingle, how did he ſoon wander from it! He was bare-foot then, but when he comes home, then the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther puts on his ſhooes; they were not of his putting on, but the Fathers, done by his command.</p>
                  <p>But all along, while I am ſpeaking to you, and am ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what divided hearts you come with, and the great loſs that is come upon you, there's great need to pray to the <hi>Father,</hi> that he would bring <hi>the ſhooes (his Love)</hi> to ſet the Affections right, to love with <hi>rightneſs, readineſs,</hi> and <hi>ſingleneſs;</hi> for if He bring them not, this evil and <hi>hypocritical will</hi> will be our undoing: But (ſaith God) <hi>You ſhall finde me, when you ſhall ſeek me with all your heart, and all your ſoul:</hi> He will be ſought to of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> And he has not ſaid to the houſe of <hi>Jacob, Seek my face in vain:</hi> But he that offers to the Lord for a ſacrifice, that which is <hi>torn</hi> or <hi>lame,</hi> and has a <hi>male</hi> in his flock<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He abhors that mans offering; He will receive none but that which is <hi>without blemiſh,</hi> and that will make our works accepted, (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) <hi>Faith, that works by Love,</hi> and doth all in ſingleneſs of Soul, That will make every thing acceptable in his ſight.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A fourth thing the Soul is to be ſhod with, is, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berneſs;</hi> for there may be a real <hi>ſingleneſs</hi> of ſpirit, and yet a great <hi>headineſs:</hi> Therefore (ſaith <hi>Paul) let your
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:169498:76"/>
Moderation be ſeen in all things:</hi> For if we cannot ſay as <hi>Job, The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away, and bleſſed be the Name of the Lord,</hi> there is not a <hi>ſober love:</hi> Therefore, <hi>Put off thy ſhooes</hi> (ſaid God to <hi>Moſes;</hi>) He was yet over-heady, and not fit to walk; as you may ſee in his ſtrait concerning <hi>Miriam,</hi> becauſe God had ſtrick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en her with Leproſie, he prays, <hi>Lord, heal her now:</hi> But (as if God ſhould have ſaid) No, thy love is too heady; <hi>Let her go out of the Camp ſeven days, and bear her ſhame, and then let her be received again.</hi> But <hi>Paul</hi> could ſay, <hi>I have learn'd in all things to be contented, both how to abound, and how to want:</hi> And this is that which God delights in; Sober love, ordered love. <hi>He that rules over men muſt be just</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,) ruling in the Fear of God, in Soberneſs, in Humility,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to be wiſe, ſlow to do evil, ſwift to do good, more ready to hear then to offer the ſacrifice of fools.</hi> What, need of this! When we are but a little brought from our hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, and can truly ſay, our love is ſingle, then we think, ſure this is enough: No, but yet <hi>be you ſober;</hi> that's the counſel.</p>
                  <p>But who will be wiſe? none but the Prodigal that has learn'd experience. <hi>Peter</hi> meant ſingly when he ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>I will lay down my life for thy ſake:</hi> But how heady was it? He was unſober in it; He knew not that was to be fulfilled, that was ordained before of God, that he ſhould deny him. <hi>All you ſhall this night</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to him) <hi>be offended becauſe of me, and ſhall leave me; for it is written, I will ſmite the Shepherd, and the ſheep ſhall be ſcattered abroad:</hi> He little thought of this.</p>
                  <p>Alas, is there no other way to find this <hi>Soberneſs,</hi> but through ſorrows, through baniſhments, ſending into Captivity? This is hard dealing indeed. But now the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:169498:77"/>
Prodigal can tell this Myſtery, now he has learn'd <hi>Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> he is made to admire at the way his father took to make him a ſober man: Now he can ſay (as <hi>David,) It was good for me that I was afflicted: A friend loves at all times:</hi> And now he ſeeth, That <hi>Love is as ſtrong as Death:</hi> It has Hinds feet, it hath quickneſs, ſingleneſs, and ſoberneſs; and when you ſhall be thus ſhod, then love as much as you can, nay then you cannot but love: And thus the ſon is welcom'd, <hi>Bring hither the best robe, and put a ring on his hand, and ſhooes on his feet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if ever we ſhall ſee this Return, then ſhall we be made to ſay as <hi>Paul, Thanks be to God that we are the ſervants of ſin.</hi> But who would fetch pearls from the bottom of the Sea? It's ten thouſand to one not to be ſpoiled in this venture: For there <hi>ſhall be but a remnant ſaved;</hi> here and there one; as <hi>the ſhaking of an Olive tree, here and there one in an uppermoſt branch.</hi> What, to be found dead and <hi>ſtinking in the grave,</hi> as <hi>Lazarus!</hi> to be incompaſt about with Harlots, &amp;c. and yet get home again! Sure the Prodigal did not diſcover himſelf to the Citizen he joyned to, that he was a <hi>Jew,</hi> for then he would not have received him; he was fain to uſe all the ſhifts he could for entertainment: And ſo do we, and yet we can find none that pities us, we cannot ſo much as feed with the ſwine. But <hi>what has God wrought!</hi> that no inchantment nor divination ſhould be againſt him. Oh the wonder! that ever he ſhould welcom his Prodigal with ſuch entertainment as I have ſhewed you. But,</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The next thing conſiderable in his <hi>Entertainment,</hi> is, <hi>And kill the fatted Calf, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Robe</hi> I ſhewed you what it was; I alſo ſhewed you why he muſt have that put on before he has meat, and why the <hi>rings</hi> and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:169498:77"/>
                     <hi>ſhooes</hi> go firſt, ſeeing he came out of the Land of famine; and the main cauſe that moved him to return, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his father he knew <hi>had bread enough,</hi> and he <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed for hunger.</hi> I ſhewed you the Reaſons, &amp;c. But why muſt he have ſuch abundance? And this is not all neither, <hi>Bring the muſick;</hi> there muſt be dancing and mirth too: Well may this be likened to <hi>Jacobs</hi> ladder, for it reached to Heaven. <hi>The fatted Calf,</hi> what's that?</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Everlasting Righteouſneſs,</hi> to be <hi>eſtabliſht with the free Spirit. Seventy weeks</hi> (ſaith <hi>Daniel) are determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to finiſh tranſgreſſion, and make an end of ſin, to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in the EVER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LASTING RIGHTEO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SNESS,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.24. This <hi>David</hi> cries out for, when his blood-guiltineſs lies upon him, <hi>O deliver me from my blood-guiltineſs</hi> (ſaith he,) <hi>eſtabliſh me with thy free Spirit,</hi> Pſal. 51.14, 12. With that Spirit Chriſt could ſay, <hi>It's my meat and drink to do the Will of my Father.</hi> This made <hi>David</hi> ſay, <hi>Thy Word is dearer to me then my neceſſary food.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what benefit is it to the man or woman that eats this <hi>fatted Calf?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are three Benefits conſiderable that comes to him by this meat.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There's refreſhment to the weary Soul: When the Inwards are dying, and ſinking, and tyred quite out, when hunger has ſmit the Inwards for want of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of <hi>God,</hi> how good then is the <hi>Spirit of Truth</hi> to refreſh to the heart? After a great abſtinence, after a long time of diſtance, then Chriſt ſaith, But <hi>I will ſend the Comforter, the Holy Ghoſt, who ſhall abide with you for ever.</hi> After many a weary ſtep, and hard pang, for want of meat, a mans inwards cloſe together, and (as it were) devour themſelves. Is it not enough that <hi>I take

                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond uſe of meat, is to <hi>ſtrengthen mans heart;</hi> ſo is the Communion of the Holy Ghoſt, a Strengthener to the Soul: As <hi>Paul</hi> prayeth concerning the <hi>Epheſians, That you might be ſtrengthened</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in your ſpirit with might in the inward man, that Chriſt might dwell in your hearts by faith, that you being root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and grounded in love,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rooted and grounded:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, That now you may be able to ſtand ſtrongly and unſhakeably through temptations, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, and all ſtorms; as the Prodigal here, now never more having a mind to wander from his fathers houſe; and this will be your happineſs indeed, if ever you attain to it. We have had many deliverances, and experiences, and helps in the wotk, but are not yet made able to <hi>ſtand:</hi> but (as <hi>David</hi> ſays) we <hi>mount up to Heaven, and down again to the deeps;</hi> not yet come home: But when God ſhall have given victory, then will there be a ſure ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; we ſhall then move no more, when once <hi>eſtabliſht upon mount Sion,</hi> that ſteady Foundation, which ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver change, nor <hi>wax old as a garment;</hi> then ſhall we ſtick to our Principles, and <hi>not after a vow enquire,</hi> as now we do. But,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Meat (if a bleſſing be with it) makes a man look well, have a good countenance; but how through want does a man look lean and ill favored? <hi>Wo is me</hi> (ſaith <hi>Jeremy,) my leanneſs, my leanneſs, the treacherous Dealers have dealt treacherouſly,</hi> &amp;c. God gave <hi>Iſrael</hi>
                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:169498:79"/>
their hearts deſire, but <hi>ſent leanneſs into their Souls.</hi> How uncomely does a lean man look? 'Twas not ſo with the Spouſe; <hi>Let me ſee thy countenance, let me hear thy voyce</hi> (ſaith Chriſt,) <hi>for ſweet is thy voyce, and thy countenance comely;</hi> ſhe was in the banqueting houſe, and her looks ſhew it: How often does Chriſt commend her? though ſhe ſaith, <hi>I am black,</hi> yet ſtill ſhe is <hi>comely: I look like one of thine</hi> (ſaith <hi>David.</hi>) If a mans heart be down and under, how feeble is his countenance? but when he is up and refreſhed, how is he bold as a Lion? <hi>The Righteous are bold as a Lion,</hi> &amp;c. When we are in by-paths, how do we hang down the head, and creep into a corner, and are loth to be ſeen? But ſurely the Promiſe is, that we ſhall be <hi>fat, and well-liking, and bring forth more fruit in old age.</hi> But what a day of leanneſs is it now with us! We ſpend our days in a Conſumption, a lingering diſeaſe has taken hold; but when we ſhall return, then ſhall the <hi>fleſh come again as the fleſh of a young child.</hi> When you ſhall look over all the Entertainment, and view it well together, it will be wonderful: but you muſt firſt be wearied out of all; and <hi>when they ſhall be weary, then they ſhall curſe their King and their God, and look upwards.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Entertainment of this Prodigal ſtill goes on, <hi>And let us eat and be merry;</hi> which is more ſtrange then all the reſt, and hath more in it: and yet that this joy ſhould accompany his Return, who had ſo ſlighted his father, and abuſed all his mercies, now to be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained thus, this is ſtrange: The Father ſets him up again amongſt the Princes at his own Table: Now he needs not be aſhamed to ſit with them in the gate, when they all ſee how the King ſmiles upon him. This is beyond all expreſſion, that ever he that was a begger ſhould be ſo adorned, ſo accepted and incompaſſed with mercies on
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:169498:80"/>
all ſides: The Father calls all his friends to ſee his glory, and invites them to this great feaſt, <hi>Come, let's eat and be merry;</hi> he calls his ſervants, all the <hi>Angels,</hi> thoſe noble Spirits, he makes them <hi>miniſtring Spirits:</hi> But <hi>to which of them does he ſay, Sit thou at my right hand?</hi> But to man he ſays, <hi>Thou art my ſon, this day have I begotten thee. There's more joy in Heaven over one ſinner that repents, then over the ninety and nine juſt perſons</hi> (the Angels) <hi>that need no repentance.</hi> Thoſe glorious Angels are made but <hi>miniſtring Spirits</hi> to attend dayly upon thoſe that ſhall be ſaved: But <hi>to be born of God,</hi> to be <hi>co-heirs with Chriſt,</hi> this is beyond all the Angels por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Come (ſaith the Father,) <hi>let us eat and be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> But for what Cauſe muſt there be ſo much mirth? &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>It ariſes from theſe two Cauſes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the liberty the Father had in himſelf. And,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the contentedneſs he had in his ſon: It ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies he was now eaſed of his grief; for when he went out, he grieved for him, he had no content in that; as if he had ſaid, <q>Well, my ſon will never be at quiet till he has had his run in Prodigality; well, I will let him go, though with many a ſad and a king heart for him.</q> He yet cries after him, <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, that thou hadſt harkened to me, then had thy Peace been as a River.</hi> And (as <hi>David</hi> for <hi>Abſalom) O my ſon Abſalom, my ſon Abſalom, would God I had dyed for thee, &amp;c.</hi> It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared well that he loved him; for how does he at his Return give him the beſt of every thing? clothes him with the <hi>beſt robe,</hi> puts <hi>rings</hi> on his hands, kills the <hi>fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Calf</hi> for him, and now has full contentedneſs in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his ſon, <hi>Let's eat and be merry;</hi> as though he ſhould ſay, I have enough, I have my ſon again. But,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:169498:80"/>What particular Grounds are there of all his mirth? why theſe three.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. (Saith the father,) <hi>Becauſe this my ſon was dead, and is alive again.</hi> And,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>He was loſt, and is found.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe I have <hi>received him ſafe and ſound.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here's cauſe indeed of Joy, if all this be true: What, to have recovery after baniſhment! Here's Joy indeed, both in his recovering, and in the fathers receiving him. But,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe he <hi>was dead, and is alive,</hi> &amp;c. If any of you ſhould have a child fall into a Well, and in all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſhould be drowned; now to have this child revive again, how would you prize him above all you did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and above all your other children? A man that is dead, is without hearing, ſeeing, ſavoring of any thing: A dead man is burdenſom to every one, yea to his deareſt friends, every one is weary of his company, and afraid of getting a taint from him: There's no hope of a dead man: Things dead turn to rottenneſs preſently. Such was this <hi>Prodigal,</hi> he was dead, without ſenſe, unſuitable to any ſociety. <hi>The dead cannot praiſe thee;</hi> but (ſaith <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah) the living, the living, they ſhall praiſe thee,</hi> &amp;c. Well may the father rejoyce, when he conſiders the caſe his ſon was in, <hi>This my ſon was dead;</hi> well might they <hi>eat and be merry</hi> at the receiving of this dead ſon alive again. When I conſider how you lie, as dead men, ſo voyd of underſtanding, and ſenſleſs, would I not rather ſay as <hi>Jeremy, O that I had a Cottage in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> &amp;c. that I might fly away from this people, and be at reſt, rather then to endure with you? But if ever deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance be, would there not be rejoycing in me indeed, to receive you, as <hi>Moſes, drawn out of the water;</hi> or as <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi> out of the Whales belly? There's cauſe indeed of
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:169498:81"/>
mirth, when <hi>the graves ſhall give up their dead, and the Sea give up its dead,</hi> then ſhall we <hi>ſing in the height of Sion:</hi> Why the Promiſe is, that God will <hi>comfort the mourners.</hi> But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This is not all neither; but, <hi>This my ſon was loſt, and is found.</hi> A man that's drowned in a River, and cannot be found again; whoſoever was the friend of that man, it's a far greater grief to him (if any of you have experience of it) to have him loſt, then to have him drowned; it's a great and reſtleſs diſquiet to think what is become of his friend. So the father cannot find this ſon, he is ſuch a fugitive; he goes to Heaven, to Hell, to ſeek his Church, and cannot tell where to find them. Such runagates are you, the Lord knows not where to meet with you, that he might ſay to the dead, <hi>Ariſe,</hi> your heart is ſo loſt, and ſetled upon nothing: But if once Chriſt could but come to your graves (as to <hi>Lazarus,</hi>) and find you there, if you were but brought to a narrow compaſs, there were hope. But to be loſt, that's above all your miſery, that <hi>Truth</hi> cannot tell where to find you: Could it but find you! though in a <hi>Goal,</hi> or <hi>Stocks,</hi> amongſt <hi>Harlots,</hi> or any where in the <hi>dirtieſt hole</hi> that could be, it would be a gladneſs. But to be as runaways, every where, and yet no where, ſometime in this Harlots houſe, &amp; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in another, this is a great woe and ſorrow. But <hi>let's be merry</hi> (ſaith the father) for <hi>I have found my ſon again that was loſt.</hi> If you could but come forth, and ſay to the Lord, <hi>Here I am,</hi> and declare the very particular place where you lie, and ſtick, 'twere happy. As a man in a miſt (when quite loſt) is glad to hallow, and call to any to give notice he is loſt, and tells them where they ſhall find him. But we ſlight it, and ſay, 'Tis true, I am in a loſt condition, but what will any telling another do me good? We think there muſt be no crying out: But the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:169498:81"/>
time will come, that you will cry before delivered, both to inſtruct others, ſaying, O come not here! as (the <hi>Lepers</hi> were to cry out to all, O come not to me; <hi>I am unclean, I am unclean:</hi>) and then there will be a cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Can you help me? can you tell me which way God delivered you? Though the <hi>Father</hi> ſent forth his <hi>word,</hi> to ſeek up his ſon, yet he came not till he was alive, quick, and ſenſible of his wants; and this made him <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe and go to his father, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The laſt thing yet remains, wherein lies the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all; and it is marvelous to conſider how the work hangs together.</p>
                  <p>A third Reaſon why the Father is merry, is, the ſafe return of his Prodigal: When the other ſon came out of the field, and heard <hi>the muſick and dancing,</hi> he asked one of the ſervants <hi>what thoſe things meant?</hi> Why (ſaith he) <hi>Thy Brother is come, and thy Father hath killed for him the fatted Calf, becauſe he hath received him ſafe and ſound.</hi> And if this ſhould not be, all would be an incompleat Salvation ſtill. But while I ſpeak the word, I ſigh to ſpeak it; Shall we ever ſee the day to be thus adorned? to have <hi>the beſt robe, the ſhooes, the ring,</hi> and <hi>the fatted Calf?</hi> to ſit at the Kings Table, and have the preſence and favor of the <hi>Father?</hi> to hear that concord between Heaven and Earth, that muſick and harmony? to hear the gladneſs of the Father and all thoſe holy Angels? to ſee the <hi>Earth,</hi> which is <hi>his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool,</hi> brought to the Will of the Heavenly? to have Heaven and Earth brought together to a meet and cloſe? Therefore <hi>Let's eat and be merry:</hi> 1. Becauſe <hi>my ſon was dead, and is alive again.</hi> 2. <hi>He was loſt, and is found.</hi> And, 3. <hi>He hath received Him ſafe and ſound.</hi> And this is wonderful, that one ſo far gone, that had been dead and loſt, that <hi>Lazarus</hi> lying four days ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:169498:82"/>
in his grave, ſhould be raiſed and made a ſound man again; that there ſhould be no deadneſs, nor confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor taint in the Principle of Life, but all return ſound; this will be a wonder! That there ſhall be no taint nor ſmell of any ill ſavor in all our words and ways left; it will be wonderful indeed, to have ſuch a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection!</p>
                  <p>There are three things conſiderable from this word <hi>To be Safe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That which is ſafe is well fenced about, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Name of the Lord is a ſtrong Tower; the Righteous runneth into it, and is ſafe, Prov.</hi> 18.10. But what's the Name of the Lord? He proclaims his Name thus; <hi>The Lord, the Lord God, merciful, and gracious, long-ſuffering, abundant in goodneſs and truth; Keeping mercy for thouſands, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving iniquity, tranſgreſſion, and ſin, and that will by no means let the guilty go free,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6, 7. When the Prodigal is compaſſed about with this Name, he is ſafe to purpoſe, with <hi>long-ſuffering, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, &amp;c.</hi> and with remembrance of this alſo, That <hi>he will by no means let the guilty go free;</hi> then is he made to give glory to his Father: This will be a ſtrong tower where the Soul may be ſafe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To <hi>be ſafe,</hi> is to be where no harm can come at him: <hi>In time of trouble</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) he ſhall hide me in his pavilion; in the ſecret of his Tabernacle ſhall he hide me, Pſal.</hi> 27.5. A pavilion ſtands in the midſt of the Army, and what harm can touch one there? To be in <hi>the City of Refuge,</hi> there the <hi>Avenger of blood</hi> cannot come neer: Now he is under the wings of his <hi>Father,</hi> no <hi>Witchcraft</hi> nor <hi>Enchantment</hi> can touch him: And when ever God ſhall make ſuch a fence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout you, your eſtate will be good indeed, when
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:169498:82"/>
thus fenced about with the Name of the Lord. But,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A man may be ſaid to be ſafe, when he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not run away to harm himſelf neither: When God makes this Covenant with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>And I will make an everlaſting Covenant with them, That I will not turn away from them to do them good, but will put my Fear into their hearts, that they</hi> SHALL NOT DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PART FROM ME, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. A man that is lock'd in the Stocks, or in a Gaol, we uſe to ſay, ſuch a man is ſafe, becauſe he cannot get away: So when God has put his <hi>Fear</hi> into the heart, it's made as an <hi>hook</hi> or <hi>anchor</hi> to the Soul, it cannot get away from him: But happy are they whom God will bring back again with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal, from the Land of their captivity into his preſence: There's the place of reſt and quiet; there the <hi>Father</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyces over his Prodigal, becauſe he has received him ſafe and ſound.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To be Sound</hi> hath theſe things conſiderable in it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A thing that is ſound may be conſidered thus, to be without rottenneſs, without fault, firm and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: Now the Prodigal (before his return) has a heart with a taint in it; and 'twill be wonderful if ever we ſhall be brought out <hi>clean, ſpotleſs, unblameable, &amp;c.</hi> It's nothing to keep a man from ſtealing when he can come at no prize; but to have the <hi>Babyloniſh garments</hi> and the <hi>wedges of gold</hi> lie before the Soul, and now not to have an <hi>Achans</hi> heart, to covet them; here will be the tryal: <hi>O let me not taste of their dainties</hi> (ſaith <hi>David.</hi>) The time was, <hi>he was envious at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity of the wicked:</hi> But now to ſee them proſper, and enjoy their portions, and yet not envy, nor cover; [in nothing to be tainted;] here will be the wonder! But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>To be Sound,</hi> is to be compleat, and without
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:169498:83"/>
deficiency; as of a Horſe that is fit for ſervice, we ſay, He is a ſound Horſe, ſound wind and limb, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, &amp;c. The Prodigal came home compleated, (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,) <hi>That you may be wholly compleat in him, not having any ſpot or blemiſh, or any ſuch thing:</hi> And, <hi>My Beloved</hi> (ſaith the Church) <hi>is wholly delectable,</hi> compleat in beauty: <hi>O that my heart were ſo direct</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) [that I were ſound in thy Law!] O Lord, how far off are we from this compleat ſoundneſs! We complain becauſe we cannot have our evil wills; but when <hi>David</hi> was delivered, <hi>O let me never taſte of their dainties</hi> (ſaith he:) Thus did the Father receive the Prodigal ſafe and ſound. But,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He received him ſo]</hi> Which intimates, That <hi>no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean thing ſhall enter:</hi> The Child ſhall be in the <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs</hi> till he <hi>know how to refuſe the evil, and chooſe the good:</hi> but we put it off, and would never learn, ſaying, When God comes indeed, we ſhall be ſo: But we muſt be brought to chooſe the thing; our wills muſt buckle to be of his minde, not his Will to ours; all this curious work was wrought in the dark: <hi>I was curiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faſhioned</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) in the lower-moſt parts of the Earth, &amp;c.</hi> When the Prodigal came to himſelf, when he firſt returned, the Father received him ſafe and ſound; ſo ſure was he fenced about with the Name of the Lord; a ſtrong fence indeed! The Father findes him <hi>in this Name,</hi> and in this he receives him; as Chriſt ſaith of <hi>Mary,</hi> She <hi>loved much, therefore much was forgiven her:</hi> So, ſafe and ſound does the Father receive him; <hi>Safe,</hi> in that he is free from all evil, nothing can touch him; and then <hi>ſafe,</hi> in that he cannot get away: and <hi>ſound,</hi> not having an evil tincture of an old rotten heart in him: Now he has no mind to return to <hi>Sodom: I remember</hi> (in that day) <hi>I look'd for all my fears that had
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:169498:83"/>
plagued me, and could not finde them;</hi> the minde was ſet on fire for God alone. Well may the Father be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry now, to receive a ſon that was once forlorn, that had neither clothes to his back, nor meat for his belly; that had no fellowſhip but Rogues, fit for every baſe Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots houſe, taking all opportunities of deſtruction; yet he is ſaved out of all, and comes home ſafe: and now for a King to entertain him thus, it was a token he was a ſon indeed; for who elſe could have the face to own ſuch a Father (ſuch a caſe as he was now in?) but he ventures, and calls him <hi>Father;</hi> and the Father own<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> him, and is glad to receive him, in how miſerable a caſe ſoever he findes him.</p>
                  <p>Thus have you ſeen the progreſs of all the Prodigal's way: Did you ſee him in his pride and bravery? <hi>(wiſer then ſeven men that can give a reaſon?)</hi> full of wealth and ſtore, having got his portion into his hands? and have you ſeen what he does with it? <hi>The rich mans wealth</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) is a high wall in his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit;</hi> ('tis but in his own conceit:) But <hi>before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a mans heart is haughty, Prov.</hi> 18.11, 12. And if you ſee him a while after, where is it all become? The time comes he is glad of an husk, if he could but feed with the ſwine; but he may not. And now he is put to his laſt ſhift, either to dye with hunger, or to return home to his Father, at a peradventure whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will receive him or no: he propoſes to himſelf, if he might but be received as a ſervant, it was far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be ſo, then as he was, for they had no want, but he ſtarved with hunger: And becauſe he comes home thus buckled, owning his ſhame, confeſſing he had ſo ſinned, and was not worthy any more of the name of a ſon, (now his commanding and claiming ſpirit is layd down;) but while he comes thus, he is largely enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:169498:84"/>
with abundance of mercies; as hath been ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you.</p>
                  <p>Now from all this you may conſider theſe <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the firſt place, here might be an Uſe of Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, or forewarning, to all thoſe that are ſons or daughters of this <hi>Father,</hi> That (if poſſible) you might take warning, and not gain this loſs to your ſelves by wandering. If a man be a Drunkard, or Swearer, &amp;c. yet he will (many times) counſel his child, that he ſhould not follow his way: And as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, ſo I ſay to you, <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> would you were all as I am, except my bonds:</hi> I would you might never have a minde to wander as the Prodigal did; you ſee what it brought him to: And all the Examples you hear of, they are all <hi>written for your admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come:</hi> And as you have ſeen the end of the World, ſo you would ſee an end of <hi>Truth</hi> too (were it in your power.) The Prodigal did not ſpend the Worlds, but his own portion; you have made an evil uſe of all the Creatures, and will you make an evil uſe of <hi>Truth</hi> too? O that you might learn inſtruction, and be wiſe! That the days paſt might ſuffice, in which you have walked perverſly; that hence-forward you might be warned to keep out of the ſnare.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It may be of Uſe for Inſtruction, to let us know of a certain, That <hi>where ever Pride goes before, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction will follow after:</hi> The Prodigal for his <hi>riotous living</hi> was rewarded with <hi>famine.</hi> It were well if you would never venture; but if you do, know of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Famine will overtake you: Therefore (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) <hi>Forſake not the aſſembling of your ſelves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the manner of ſome is, who are thereby harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> Where preſumption goes before, hardneſs of heart will follow: Therefore it's no marvel to ſee us lean and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:169498:84"/>
barren; it is becauſe that proud ſpirit has gone before; which has brought it on us; that promis'd you, you ſhould not be poor, but <hi>ſit as a Lady for ever, &amp;c.</hi> We have promiſed our ſelves we would be diligent and watchful, not envy nor deſpiſe any; but when the heart is once out, it's hard to come in again: When <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> heart had got out to look upon the woman, he preſently ſends for her Husband, then makes him drunk, then ſends him with a Letter to the Army, to take his life away; and all that he might enjoy his Wife: So when the heart is once out, how does it heap one lye and miſchief upon another! O therefore conſider how you get out; for if you are once gone, it's not ſuch an eaſie thing to come in again: <hi>The beginning of ſtrife</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) is like the breaking out of water;</hi> The gap is made bigger and bigger, till at laſt it cannot be ſtopt.</p>

                  <p>IN all Times God had ſome to whom He hath been pleaſed to communicate his mind about what was to befall the world; and therefore he ſaith, He <hi>will do nothing but he will reveal it to his ſervants the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets;</hi> and to them, the <hi>forewarning</hi> they have had from God, hath not been a ſlight Thing, an idle Tale, or a Fable, but it hath taken impreſſion: As with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Prophets, how have they cryed out in bitter diſtreſs, <hi>That they were pained at the very heart, and their bowels ſhook within,</hi> &amp;c. at the ſight of the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which were to come on a People, before the thing was done, or any preſent danger in view! And ſo here, <hi>Noah</hi> is warned of God of things to come, (though not at all yet ſeen,) and ſee what place it took: He was <hi>moved with fear,</hi> and that fear was not in vain neither, but put him upon a work: <hi>He prepared an Ark to the ſaving of himſelf and his houſe.</hi> And therefore where ever we hear of <hi>great high words,</hi> of <hi>great diſcoveries</hi> and <hi>revealings of God</hi> to any (which many now in the world pretend to,) and yet all they ſpeak of takes no place upon their ſpirits, (there is no fear, nor awe, nor dread, no <hi>paining of heart,</hi> nor <hi>ſhaking of inwards,</hi> but they can live ſtill as looſely and vainly as ever, after their own fleſhly wills,) this is a token God hath not ſpoke
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:169498:88"/>
there; but ſpeak a <hi>falſe Viſion</hi> of their own hearts. But God hath in all Ages had ſome to whom he hath revealed what he hath intended to do, to give warning to the world before-hand, that when the Judgment comes, they may know it comes not by chance and hap, but that he hath a hand in it. So Chriſt to his Diſciples, <hi>When theſe things come to paſs, you may remember that I have told you.</hi> And it is often mentioned, That ſuch and ſuch things came to paſs, <hi>that the Scriptures might be fulfilled:</hi> The Word which God had ſpoke to his ſervants, that muſt not fall to the ground. And thus was <hi>Noah</hi> warned of God of <hi>Things not yet ſeen;</hi> He had onely a word for it, and yet believes: So <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> but a word from God to call him, and <hi>He goes out, not knowing whither he went.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">I. WHAT THINGS THEY WERE THAT <hi>NO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AH</hi> WAS WARNED OF? Theſe three.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He was warned, That <hi>all fleſh had corrupted its way, Gen.</hi> 6.12. This Word came to him from God, firſt, before the thing was ſo proved and known to him, that all fleſh was ſo corrupt, nothing at all good in man; but <hi>the imaginations of his heart alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether evil, and that continually.</hi> Now there is a <hi>birth of the fleſh</hi> that ſeems very like <hi>the Child of God,</hi> but yet it will not be owned, it muſt not be Heir with <hi>Iſaac: What ever is born of the fleſh, is fleſh;</hi> it is no better, and the beſt of fleſh is corrupt; <hi>All fleſh,</hi> how fair and ſpecious ſoever it may ſeem. And the ſame warning is now ſent to you this day, That All in you is corrupt before God; an <hi>evil taint</hi> runs in all, in the beſt we do; a <hi>dead Fly</hi> ſpoyls the whole Box of oyntment: <hi>In my fleſh</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) dwelleth no good thing.</hi> But we plead, we do not ſo ſee this, that
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:169498:89"/>
we are ſo wrong and guilty in all. Well, but <hi>Noah</hi> is <hi>warned of God of things not yet ſeen,</hi> not yet ſo clear to his eyes, and he believes the Word, and the warning ſent, and ſtands not to parl the caſe with God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He was warned, that <hi>the end of all fleſh was come before God;</hi> that a day of account was coming, a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a Flood to drown all fleſh. God will not always ſtrive and bear, but the end comes: And this Word <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> believes, though nothing as yet is ſeen, but all is well, and at peace, <hi>eating and drinking, marrying, and giving in marriage;</hi> yet he obſerves the warning, and believes the Word, and ſubmits and cleaves to it: The warning is given him, <hi>Depart from the tents of theſe wicked men, left ye periſh with them,</hi> &amp;c. and he obeys.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He is warned of God to <hi>prepare an Ark</hi> for the ſafeguard of himſelf and his houſe: And what a ſtrange and mad thing would this ſeem to all the reſt of the world? They could not but laugh and mock at it; <q>What doth this man intend? is <hi>he wiſer then all the World?</hi> and will he go contrary to all? to build <hi>an Ark</hi> when <hi>no Flood nor danger appears;</hi>
                     </q> this ſeems a mad way to Reaſon. Well, but <hi>Noah</hi> was warned of God, and that is enough to him; though the thing is not yet ſeen, yet he believes the Word, and ſets to the work, and goes on alone; let them ſay what they will to him, and mock on, he obſerves the warning; as <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.22. <hi>And Noah did according to all that God had commanded him; ſo did he.</hi> Now to bring this home to our conditions; (for <hi>Noah</hi> is dead, and the Word yet concerns <hi>us:</hi>) It is certain we have been warned of God, as he was, in all theſe three Caſes. And,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That <hi>all fleſh hath corrupted its way,</hi> we have been warned of God theſe three ways.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>By a word of true report:</hi> God hath told you
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:169498:89"/>
again and again, That <hi>all fleſh is graſs,</hi> that there is no good thing in man. How long hath the Cryer cryed this, That <hi>all fleſh is wholly corrupted?</hi> Though it be never ſo fair and goodly, and the <hi>Sepulchre painted,</hi> yet there is nothing but rottenneſs and filthineſs within. The mans fleſhly wiſdom, that which is his guide and Counſeller, the <hi>eyes</hi> that he ſees with, the <hi>feet</hi> he walks with, even that hath been a corrupt taint in all our ways; and this hath often and often been told you, and yet you go on, and paſs the Condition over, and ſleep deſperately upon the top of a Maſt, and go contrary to all that comes to cut down fleſh, and deſtroy your wiſdom, and vain imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You have been warned of this, <hi>by a work upon your own ſpirits:</hi> And if you believe not the <hi>Word,</hi> yet will you not believe for the <hi>Works ſake?</hi> Have you not been ſpoyled and ruined by the charms and falſe flatteries of this <hi>whoriſh woman</hi> [the fleſh] all along your days? Have you not proved out the thing throughly? And yet we plead, we do not ſo ſee it: We would juſtifie our ſelves in ſomething according to the fleſh. But have we not ſeen? have we not felt it to our loſs, what a treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous dealer <hi>this fleſh</hi> hath been? It is then, becauſe we would not ſee it, but blind our eyes; and if we ſtand here pleading, we may ſtick long enough in the mire, and ſee no deliverance, if we will firſt ſee, and not at all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve our miſery and danger. <hi>Noah</hi> was warned of <hi>things not ſeen,</hi> and he believes the Word told him. Now you call me your Guide, and witneſs that God is with me: But how appears it you judg ſo indeed? Would you not live after your own counſels ſtill; rather then the <hi>Truths?</hi> Would you not ſee with your own eyes? and not ſtir a ſtep farther then your own Reaſon can reach? But whoſe heart trembles, when the Word goes forth from
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:169498:90"/>
Chriſt, <hi>One of you ſhall betray me;</hi> to ſay, <hi>Lord, is it I?</hi> or, <hi>Is it I?</hi> Who fears, and lays it to heart, when the Cryer tells you day by day (and complains bitterly under it,) That <hi>All fleſh is corrupted?</hi> Who is touched to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, <q>Good Lord, is it ſo with me! is all in me cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted? all my hopings, and reſolvings, and turnings, and puttings off the ſtrait? is there a taint in all, which way ſoever I turn me!</q> and doth not our experience prove this out to us alſo? Have we not ſeen an <hi>end of all perfection?</hi> and yet how ſtrangely do we ſtick to our ſhadows, which we have proved out to be dry and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? and like the fooliſh Bee, light again and again upon the ſame flower, when it can yield no more honey. And thus your days may be worn out, and ſpent, and come to nothing, if you will neither be warned of God, nor your own experience, to lie down in the duſt, and abhor your ſelves in aſhes, and own your own wretchedneſs. All I ſpeak, is, to bring you <hi>to a ſtrait for help,</hi> and <hi>to ſee it is not in your ſelves;</hi> it grows not in that ſoyl, though you till and manure it never ſo carefully. What is the Reaſon (think you) we are not removed, not <hi>tranſlated into another Kingdom,</hi> another condition, but ſtick ſtill where we were ſeven years ago? What are we molded and wrought into of the mind and likeneſs of God? We have more <hi>light</hi> indeed then we had, but what hath it brought us to? What have we ſubmitted under and parted with of our <hi>lives</hi> and <hi>wills!</hi> &amp;c. We turn like <hi>the door upon the hinges, ſo the ſluggard upon his bed;</hi> and if we turn, and turn never ſo often, upon a fleſhly bed, alas, all comes to nothing, ſo long as we move upon that centre of <hi>fleſhly wiſdom,</hi> and will <hi>believe God no farther then we can ſee him,</hi> but keep off our miſery; though we are warned by the voyce of the Cryer, and warned by our own hearts, to know how deceiveably they have
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:169498:90"/>
dealt with us; yet we will hold our hold, and not give up all fleſh for corrupt and wretched, and cry out, <hi>In me, that is, in my fleſh, dwells no good thing:</hi> Till this, we muſt welter in our miſery, no Cure will come.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We have been <hi>warned by Providence</hi> of this; an ordering Hand of God hath preach'd, That <hi>all fleſh is graſs.</hi> How hath it taken away ſome of us by <hi>Death?</hi> and how hath <hi>the world</hi> a late been let looſe upon the reſt? What <hi>plots</hi> and <hi>contrivances</hi> are there on foot to break us a pieces, if the Lord prevent not? What ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are there and waitings for our halting? And what mean all theſe ſtirs and hurly-burlies? Sure they have an end, they come for the <hi>deſtruction of the fleſh,</hi> they come to ſhew that fleſh yet lives, that there is a fleſhly coming together, fleſhly hearing and truſting in our outward mercies, crying, <hi>The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord;</hi> and ſo reſt in the ſhadow, and come not to the preparing of an <hi>Ark</hi> indeed: And therefore you ſee how it hath fallen upon ſome of us, to be divided, and taken away by force; and carried to ſtrange Tryals: And think not with your ſelves, that <hi>they were greater ſinners then the reſt;</hi> No, but certainly unleſs we <hi>repent</hi> (that are yet left together) the Hand will go againſt us, and the men of the world ſhall have their wills to root us out from being a People.</p>
                  <p>Therefore if we ſhall be warned this day to lay it to heart, it will be well; if the <hi>Word,</hi> and the <hi>Work,</hi> and the <hi>preſent hand of Providence,</hi> if all make you conſider and know that all fleſh hath corrupted its way, and that out of fleſh you muſt come, then it's well. Out of <hi>Sodom</hi> you muſt come, that is certain; and if one thing will not do it, another ſhall. We have certainly lived all of us beſides the mercies afforded: <hi>We might have been
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:169498:91"/>
Teachers of others for the time;</hi> but alas, we have been dull of hearing, and have need to be taught into the firſt Principles of <hi>repentance from dead works:</hi> Therefore there is need now at the laſt you ſhould be warned, That <hi>all fleſh is graſs;</hi> and this you will grant in a word: But come to <hi>particulars,</hi> and there your <hi>fleſhly wiſdom</hi> wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> be <hi>Judg, what is right,</hi> and <hi>what is wrong;</hi> and <hi>fleſh will never judg it ſelf:</hi> and ſo all is kept off from ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the heart; for certainly elſe you could never keep up to live alone, as you do (upon your own thoughts and counſels) without the Lord: As it is ſaid, <hi>God is not in all their thoughts.</hi> Oh therefore, <hi>Conſider this all you that forget God! And whileſt it is called to day, harden not your hearts.</hi> Fall under the mighty hand, and own your miſery; and if you know it not, be jealous, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire with fear, What means this voyce of the Cryer? 'Am I indeed ſo corrupt and miſerable, and know it not! Say with <hi>Job, What I know not, teach thou me,</hi> till the Thing be opened; for ſome way or other this Leſſon muſt be learn'd you, That <hi>All fleſh is graſs;</hi> and the Lord ſpares none of you, and nothing in any of you; but <hi>All fleſh, the whole Houſe of Iſrael have corrupted their way:</hi> You are all guilty, and have turned aſide to <hi>vain things,</hi> and have forſaken the Lord days with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out number, and the ſtrait is not yet upon you: The Lord make you ſenſible where you ſtand! But then,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We have been warned of that too (as <hi>Noah</hi> was) That <hi>the End of all fleſh is come before God.</hi> How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hath this been told you, That He will not always bear, His Spirit will not ever ſtrive? The Patience will wear out at the laſt, nay it is even expired; and if the Lord move you not with fear, as <hi>Noah</hi> was moved, to prepare an Ark, deſolation will ſurely come, <hi>the Flood</hi>
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:169498:91"/>
will overtake you ſome way or other; either <hi>Death</hi> will come and bind us faſt from our wills in the grave, or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings from <hi>unreaſonable men</hi> will come to ſhatter us aſunder, and break us in pieces; and then whither ſhall we turn for counſel and help in our ſtraits? How may we then prize the days which we now ſlight? Surely one way or other God will take to bring <hi>All Fleſh</hi> to an end: And if we have no other hope nor confidence but in the fleſh, if we ſtick ſtill in our <hi>ſelf-wills,</hi> and <hi>fleſhly minds,</hi> we ſhall <hi>not be able to ſtand in that day.</hi> It is not your high looks nor great thoughts that will then carry you out; not your <hi>knowledg of Scriptures,</hi> nor <hi>underſtanding of Myſteries;</hi> none of your carnal hopes, nor carnal fears, nor carnal reaſonings, will now ſtand, as they have done formerly; but the Flood will ſweep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all that is born of the fleſh. Therefore if we ſhall be made to judg our ſelves before-hand, and cry out, <hi>O ſearch me, and try me, if there be any way of wickedneſs in me!</hi> and bow under the Judgment, then it's well for us: But if there be ſuch a ſaying within, <hi>I ſhall have peace in the way of my own heart;</hi> this evil ſhall not come that is ſpoke of; I ſhall have eaſe and reſt, and <hi>dye in my nest</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job;</hi>) if thus you put <hi>the evil day</hi> far from you, it will ſurely overtake you unawares, in a day when you think not of it; <hi>when they were eating, and drinking, and marrying, the Flood came!</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We have been alſo warned (as <hi>Noah</hi> was) to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare an Ark:</hi> We have been minded often, both from a Word without, and ſtirrings within, to look after a ſure teſting place, a Refuge, a ſhelter, that which will keep off all Floods, and ſtorms, and Tryals. <hi>Though the Earth be moved into the midſt of the Sea, yet</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) I will not fear;</hi> His heart is fixed, truſting in the Lord: And in another place, <hi>My heart is fixed O God, my heart is
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:169498:92"/>
fixed:</hi> There is, ſure, ſuch a place whither the Righteous can flee, and <hi>they are ſafe;</hi> In the <hi>Name of the Lord,</hi> in <hi>that Tower, under his wing,</hi> in the <hi>ſecret of his Pavili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> in his Boſom <hi>[in his Love]</hi> when that is opened to the Soul, and a manſion given it there. Now if thou haſt all parts, and knowledg, and operations, and good deſires, and good reſolvings, <hi>all theſe will not ſave thee in the day of the Flood:</hi> The Waters will get above, over all the high Mountains, the whole Earth, how high ſoever it be; yet if it be of the Earth, if it be <hi>born of the fleſh,</hi> and <hi>the will of man,</hi> it will not ſtand. But <hi>There is a Reſt for the People of God:</hi> Waſt thou ever brought into that? Hath the Lord Jeſus ever ſhewed thee thy <hi>lot</hi> and <hi>portion</hi> in that <hi>Eternal Love?</hi> that thou art choſen there, in the Beloved? Nothing elſe will carry it out againſt the Flood; when that comes to overflow, nothing then but that <hi>everlaſting Rock.</hi> Many are wiſe, and great, and honorable, and knowing in their generation, <hi>famous,</hi> and <hi>men of renown;</hi> but alas! when they come to dye, they have no underſtanding, but are found like <hi>the beaſt that periſh;</hi> They are to ſeek their ſhelter when the ſtorms beat. But now to have a portion made over to thee in that <hi>Eternal Love,</hi> that will be a ſure Ark in the time of the Deluge; this will be the happineſs: And ſuch a condition as this you have been warned of God, and are warned, to preſs after, and to reſt in nothing till this Ark be prepared for you.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Conſider next, <hi>He being moved with Fear,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The Warning takes place upon him, and leaves an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion behind, it moves and touches his heart, and that from theſe five Conſiderations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He was <hi>moved with fear,</hi> from that warning to him, That <hi>All fleſh was corrupt;</hi> a fear ſeizeth on him, and makes him enquire, <q>Is it indeed ſo as the Lord hath
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:169498:92"/>
ſpoken? Though I ſee not ſo clearly, that All is ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and vile, yet what means this warning from God? Surely the caſe is worſe then I yet ſee it; ſure I am lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and hoping in ſome wrong thing, ſome arm of fleſh or other, that the Lord warns me thus.</q> Hence the Fear moves upon him, and makes him look inwards.</p>
                  <p>Now doth this come home to your doors? Do you enquire whether theſe things are ſo or not? Alas, how is it with me? How ſtands the caſe between God and Me? What means the complaint and cry, That <hi>All is corrupt?</hi> Doth the Lion roar, and are you not afraid? Or do you ſtand upon your terms with <hi>Corah,</hi> and ſay, <hi>All the Lords People are holy?</hi> [We are not ſo baſe and vile as you would make us believe.] If you plead ſo, you ſhall know ſhortly (as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid to them) who are the Lords People, and who are not: The ſearch and dividing will come; and if thy money be good, thou art not afraid to bring it out; Thou wilt not ſhrink from being enquired into; Thou wilt come to the Light, if thy works be good. But this will be a teſtimony the caſe is bad, if either there be a <hi>ſnuffing</hi> and taking it ill to be put thus on the Tryal, or if a <hi>ſhuffling it off</hi> and laying it aſide till to morrow; or if a <hi>fear,</hi> and ſhrinking, and covering the condition cloſe to your ſelves; or if a <hi>wilful ſtubbornneſs</hi> and <hi>ſcorning</hi> to come to the Touch-ſtone: <hi>If thou be a ſcorner, thou alone ſhalt bear it,</hi> that is certain, thou ſhalt be <hi>alone</hi> by thy ſelf; and <hi>woe to him that is alone.</hi> Who ever is in an Error, or evil way, he is ſurely alone in it: There are not two in the whole world that are fully to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in an evil way, but ſome flaw and difference creeps in do what they can; for it is a ſpirit of confuſion and diviſion; and there is no <hi>true <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion and Oneneſs but in the Spirit of Love and Truth:</hi> Therefore enquire if there be not a canker-worm, a taint, in all thy beſt things, in
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:169498:93"/>
thy Knowledg, Fear, Hope, Believing, Deſiring, &amp;c. if all be not corrupt: And will not this cauſe a Fear?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He was <hi>moved with Fear,</hi> to conſider, <q>Is an end of all fleſh coming? Is a Judgment ſo near? Is it certain that an Account will be called for from me in all my ways, and nothing of fleſh ſhall ſtand? and do I ſleep in this condition? Am I ſecure, and the Judgment ſo nigh at the door, ready to deſtroy all?</q> Hence the Fear moves and works upon the ſenſible Soul.</p>
                  <p>Now enquire, whether this Fear touch upon you or not: If you are not brought to be knit up to the Lord Chriſt, and be made <hi>one Spirit</hi> with him, you will be ſure to be left behind to the periſhing world. I wonder ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times how you can have any reſt upon your ſpirits; how you can go through your buſineſs, and eat, and ſleep, and talk, or mind any thing, whileſt your Souls hang at ſuch an uncertainty; and thou knoweſt not what ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of thee in the latter end: If there be nothing but <hi>fleſh</hi> in thee, though never ſo high, and fair, and refined, yet it will come to an end, it will not ſtand in the fire; for <hi>what is the chaff to the wheat</hi> (ſaith the Lord?) Now if thou ſearcheſt into thy ſelf, art thou ſure thou canſt find any thing better then fleſh? another ſpirit <hi>ſeed of God?</hi> and then art thou ſure that this is thine, and ſhall ever abide with thee, and be in thee? (For if the Spirit be taken from thee, as it was from <hi>Saul,</hi> then thou art miſerable,) for that alone muſt ſtand in this day. Therefore art thou ſure thou haſt that which will carry thee out through Death and Hell, when the Flood comes to drown the whole Earth? Now you are at eaſe, and quiet, and in health, and go and come at will; but do you not think <hi>a Flood will come and ſweep away all fleſh?</hi> Do you not think you muſt dye, and part with all your wills, and loves, and deſires that are not born of God? Therefore
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:169498:93"/>
what need is there this Fear ſhould ſeize upon you, leſt you ſhould not be able to ſtand in that day?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He was <hi>moved with Fear</hi> in this Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That <hi>he is naked, and hath no Ark to betake him to:</hi> The Judgment is at hand, the <hi>Deluge</hi> ready to ſeize, and he hath no ſhelter nor place to turn to; and this makes the caſe harder to him, then the reſt of the World, which ſaw not the danger: and hence the Fear ſeizeth; Alaſs, his ſhelter is not yet prepared, the Ark not made!</p>
                  <p>Now, do you ſearch and enquire into this? Have you an Ark at hand, to receive you, or not? Are you provided for ſuch a day or no? Are you ſure you ſhall ſtand in the fire, and not be conſumed? Do you know you ſhall go through with your building, and that mock not fall upon you, <hi>This man began to build, but was not able to finiſh?</hi> Doth this Fear touch upon your Souls, as it did on <hi>Noahs? There is a Reſt for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God,</hi> that's ſure; an Inheritance in Light, reſerved for the Saints: But is it your portion, or is it not? I wonder I hear not that voyce among you to cry out, <hi>Oh, who ſhall ſtand when God doth this?</hi> when the Searcher comes with <hi>his fan in his hand,</hi> with <hi>refiners fire,</hi> and <hi>fullers ſoap!</hi> when <hi>every plant ſhall be plucked up that my heavenly Father hath not planted!</hi> This may ſeem light, now, and a vain enquiry to many that are high, and at eaſe, and think to dye in their neſts; (as ſure, they could not but mock at <hi>Noah</hi> in his day: <q>What is this Fool doing? What need of all this ſtir to build an Ark?</q> what need is there? to what purpoſe?) I, but when the Flood comes where are the Mockers then? What is the Hypocrites hope?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Another thing that might move <hi>Noah</hi> to fear, might be this, leſt he ſhould ſlip over the preſent <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi>
                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:169498:94"/>
and <hi>warning</hi> given him; leſt he ſhould neglect the preſent day, and then it may be too late: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Soul that is ſenſible is afraid, a jealouſie ſtrikes the heart; O what would come on me, if I ſhould withſtand my Mercy? How were many envited to the Feaſt? but becauſe they made excuſes, and neglected the offer, the door is ſhut; and he ſwears, <hi>They ſhall not taſte of his Supper.</hi> But now <hi>Joſiahs</hi> heart was ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der when the Judgments were read before him out of the Law; it took place in his Soul: And <hi>Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cai</hi> ſays to <hi>Eſther,</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>Who knows but thou wert rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up for ſuch a time as this?</hi> [If now thou ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not thy ſelf, thou mayſt never have another offer:]</q> And here the Fear comes in, Leſt the day ſlip, and can never be recalled again: and therefore Chriſt weeps o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Jeruſalem, O that thou hadſt known in this thy Day the things that belong to thy Peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now ſee; doth this Fear touch your Souls? Are you ſtruck with an awe of ſpirit, leſt you ſhould ſlip away the preſent day of Mercy? Doth it preſs upon you, That <hi>whileſt it is called to day, you harden not your hearts?</hi> and then the word go forth, <hi>You ſhall never enter into his Reſt?</hi> Truly the venture is hard, were our Souls but awakened: If thou ſlip the nick, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not the time of thy Viſitation, He may never ſpeak more of the things concerning thy Peace; but that ſad concluſion may come, <hi>Now they are hid from thine eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Noah</hi> might be moved with Fear out of this conſideration, leſt <hi>the Flood ſhould take him unawares,</hi> before his Ark was finiſhed; and therefore he ſets to the work preſently: <hi>And Noah did as the Lord command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, ſo did he;</hi> leſt he ſhould be prevented, and not
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:169498:94"/>
finiſh his Ark in time, and then all his labor and pains are loſt; this ſtrikes him with fear.</p>
                  <p>Now conſider; doth it take this place upon thy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? Doth it ſet thy Soul to the work preſently, <hi>now</hi> [this very ſeaſon,] to ſay, <hi>Men and Brethren, what ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi> Doth it make you look out for a guide to lead you on, and counſel you in the work? For an <hi>Interpreter, one of a thouſand, to ſhew to man His Righteouſneſs?</hi> Sure the <hi>Idol gods</hi> keep the room, (ſome baſe luſts, or hopes, or promiſing your ſelves Peace,) or elſe you would be afraid: and all that God intends that everlaſting good to, ſure the ſtrait will come, That they ſhall not be ſuffered to let <hi>their eyes ſleep, nor their eye-lids ſlumber, till they ſhall finde out an habitation for the God of Jacob.</hi> Do theſe things take place upon you or not? if not, what is the cauſe? what hinders, you are not baptized? Are you ſenſleſs and carnal, living in the fleſh, upon any ſeen thing? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſs! That is miſerable, the Flood will come and ſweep away all of that kinde: Whileſt <hi>they were eating and drinking, and marrying, and giving in marriage, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares the Flood came.</hi> Or canſt thou give a good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count what will be thy latter end? and canſt ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>We know, that if this earthly Tabernacle be diſſolved, we have a building, not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens?</hi> I would you could ſay that word indeed. But, O Lord, when I think of it! what if he ſhould come now unawares this night! where are your mindes? Are you fit to go out and meet the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom? Are not your Hearts either cavilling, or reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or murmuring, or hunting and luſting after ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what? or fearing and ſinking under your bonds? But who has a minde prepared <hi>to meet the Lord in the ayr, and ſo be for ever with him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:169498:95"/>Thus I have ſhewed you what the <hi>things not ſeen</hi> were, of which <hi>Noah</hi> is warned. 1. God tells him, <hi>All fleſh is corrupt.</hi> 2. That <hi>the end of all fleſh is come.</hi> 3. He invites him <hi>to build an Ark to ſave himſelf.</hi> And this I applyed to our preſent condition; for <hi>Noah</hi> is dead, and <hi>this is written for our inſtruction.</hi> I told you how we have been warned in theſe caſes; And that, 1. By a word that hath cryed long to us, <hi>All fleſh is graſs.</hi> 2. By the proof of our hearts. 3. By a voyce of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, letting out the world, and the out-cries of men againſt us, if it be poſſible, to break us aſunder, and not leave a ſtone upon a ſtone. Then I told you how the thing took place with <hi>Noah,</hi> He <hi>was moved with Fear,</hi> from five Conſiderations; all which might ſeize upon us, and cauſe an awful dread and enquiry in our ſpirits: 1. To ſee what is our confidence and hope that we lean on; Is it not born of the fleſh? And then, though it be never ſo fair-ſpun a threed, though never ſo wiſe, and ſober, and patient, and meek; yet if it ſpring not from a good root, if it be born of the fleſh, all is nothing: You cannot <hi>love Him</hi> unleſs it be opened that <hi>He firſt loves you.</hi> Now many pretend that they <hi>love God,</hi> and prize and honor him; do you ſo? but are you ſure that he <hi>loves you?</hi> What if he ſhall anſwer you in that day, when you plead, <hi>Lord, we have eat and drunk in thy preſence, and thou haſt taught in our ſtreets;</hi> (well, but for all that) <hi>I know you not</hi> (ſaith Chriſt,) <hi>Depart from me, &amp;c.</hi> How will your Love to God then ſtand? Have you indeed an Ark prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you in the great overflowing Deluge? in the day of <hi>desperate ſorrow,</hi> that ſhall come to try all that dwell upon the Earth? The Day will ſurely come ere long; now are you ſure you have that which will carry you through? 'Tis not your Learning, nor Knowing (if you
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:169498:95"/>
knew all Myſteries,) 'tis not your Parts, nor Hopes, nor <hi>mans concluſions</hi> will do it. Many <hi>meaſure themſelves by themſelves;</hi> [they are not as they were, they are more ſtrict and obſervant:] I, but what then? Will that carry you out? And many meaſure <hi>themſelves with others,</hi> and ſay, <q>I am better then ſuch and ſuch; I am not like this <hi>Publican:</hi>
                     </q> Well; but they that thus meaſure themſelves with themſelves, and others, <hi>are not wiſe</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul:</hi>) the root and principle may yet be Self, and then what the better? Then,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This might move us to fear, That <hi>the end of all fleſh is come:</hi> God will not always wink as he hath done in the days of Ignorance; if he ſhould, we would never come up to any thing: And will not this ſtrike upon you an awe? That the Judgment lies at the door; Death is entring in at the windows, and nothing of fleſh, nor mans Will, though never ſo <hi>fairly painted</hi> and <hi>gilded over,</hi> will be <hi>able to ſtand!</hi> Is it not time to fear?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Have you an Ark prepared to ſhelter you? a <hi>ſure resting place</hi> from all ſtorms? if not, is there not great cauſe of fear and trembling? I know not one of you, if you were called this night to dye, that are at a <hi>certainty</hi> for your conditions, what ſhall become of you; you have nothing <hi>certain</hi> to ſtick to: If you look over all your treaſure, your hopes, and promiſes, and operations from <hi>Truth;</hi> yet <hi>the bed is too ſhort, and the covering too narrow.</hi> I remember the ſaying of an old Profeſſor, which was long my Guide and Teacher, and many years had been zealous, and ſtrong, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in Religion; yet when he lay upon his death-bed, and great things were expected from him, <hi>I know not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>whether all that ever I have done in all my life hath not been in hypocriſie.</hi> All his great confidence
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:169498:96"/>
was gone in a moment, and he at a pitiful uncertainty what ſhould become of him. I am ſure it made my heart ſtartle, to hear it, and ſay in my Soul, Art thou now to ſeek after all? then what ſhall become of me who am far ſhort, and but a new beginner!</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This Conſideration may move you to fear, <hi>Not knowing how ſoon the day of Mercy may be ſlipt over, and the day of Viſitation hid from our eyes.</hi> It hath been no ſmall Mercy, the peaceable Government we have lived under, we have had Liberty and Peace to meet together; it is more then was afforded in my day, it coſt me dearer. But now do you think it will laſt always? Is there not a fear upon you, leſt the day be gone, and a breaking and ſcattering ſhould befall us? And then <hi>we may remember Sion, and weep by the Rivers of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> in our bonds!</p>
                  <p n="5">5. This moved <hi>Noah</hi> with Fear, leſt the Deluge ſhould come before his Ark was finiſhed; and therefore he preſently haſtens to the work, and did as the Lord commanded him. Now doth it take this place? Are your Souls afraid leſt the day ſhould come unawares, and prevent you? Sure if you are, it will put you out of hand to look after a ſhelter, and preſently to ſet upon the work to <hi>prepare an Ark.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. The next general Thing to be Conſidered, will be,</p>

Now the Ark had three Stories, which type out three Conditions and ſtates that Chriſt went through, to finiſh and compleat the great Work of Salvation.</p>

                     <item>2. <hi>A day of his Reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Grave.</hi> This the 2. Story Of the Ark.</item>

                  </list>
                  <p>And all the ſaved ones muſt tread in the ſame ſteps, and go through theſe three conditions in the work of Salvation, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Chriſt had <hi>a day of weakneſs, a day of death and ſufferings;</hi> He was crucified out of weakneſs: And if ever you will build this <hi>Ark,</hi> to the <hi>ſaving of your ſouls,</hi> you muſt begin at this loweſt Story: <hi>If we are planted into the likeneſs of his Death, we ſhall be alſo into the likeneſs of his Reſurrection: If you ſuffer with him, you ſhall reign with him: If you take up his croſs, and be faithful to the Death, He will give you a crown of Life:</hi> But <hi>if you deny him, he will deny you:</hi> If we <hi>drink not with him in the cup of Vinegar and Gall, we ſhall not drink of that new wine with him in the Kingdom of God.</hi> If you will indeed be like Him, you muſt begin here. No man can build a Caſtle in the Ayr, if there be no Foundation; and there is no other Foundation but <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST,</hi> AND HIM CRUCIFIED. Now this Death of Chriſt takes in a large compaſs; and who will follow him here?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>He dyed to all things, both lawful and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:</hi> He ſought not Himſelf in any thing: He could have prayed to his Father, and have commanded Legions of Angels to ſave him: He was Lord of all, and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came poor, and made himſelf of no reputation: He layd down all his juſt Rights and Priviledges, and comes not to do his own Will, but the Will of another.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:169498:97"/>
Now if you look it over, how hard are we to part with <hi>unlawful things!</hi> We are holding what in our own Conſciences belongs not to us, and we have no right to; nor can we have peace in the enjoyment of it: and yet how is the heart gathering, and reaching, and covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing! <q>O fill my belly, clothe my back, pity my caſe, conſider my tryals:</q> And thus every one would ſcram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble all to himſelf, and never care what becomes of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though in our Conſciences we know theſe reachings are utterly ſinful and unlawful. But now who will follow Chriſt in that other Branch? Who will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to dye to <hi>lawful things?</hi> that which we may juſtly plead a right and title to? To clear our ſelves where we are innocent, to have our Love anſwered with Love, to have others deal with us as we deal with them; This we ſay we may juſtly plead for: I, but to <hi>ſuffer wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,</hi> to be <hi>numbred with Tranſgreſſors,</hi> to be <hi>counted a wine-bibber, a companion of Publicans and Sinners, one having a Devil, a Deceiver, a Blasphemer;</hi> Thus it was with Chriſt, though he was without ſin; <hi>neither was guile found in his mouth:</hi> And yet this he takes up, and lies under, and lays down his neck to the block and ſubmits: <hi>This is your hour, and the power of Darkneſs;</hi> No more but ſo: Who will follow Chriſt here? to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>ſervants to ride on horſeback,</hi> and <hi>thou,</hi> though a <hi>Prince</hi> (one truly belonging to God) yet <hi>to go on foot?</hi> Thus did Chriſt; He went on, taking up his Croſs dayly; and this Croſs was not onely outward ſufferings and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, and denyals from the World; but alaſs! it takes in <hi>a parting with, and dying to, all ſeen things,</hi> all that the Will ſticks to, all that the Soul chooſes, all that is dear and precious, to give up all: Chriſt could juſtly have pleaded, That he had a right to God, a right to all the Creatures; He might have enjoyed of the beſt the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:169498:97"/>
World affords: No; but He reſigns up his Will to the Will of his <hi>Father:</hi> He gives up all; and though He was rich, yet became poor, &amp;c. And if you come not to this, to follow him here, you ſhall never build this Ark: And wo to the <hi>wantons of this world,</hi> that talk highly and largely for God, but live looſely, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the Croſs of Chriſt as much as any; <hi>will not enter themſelves, nor ſuffer others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. He did not only dye to all things lawful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, but He did it <hi>quietly</hi> and <hi>patiently;</hi> He took it well, He gave up his life, He layd it down, none took it from him: But how far are we from this? When any thing is hard indeed, and pinches us to the heart, how do we ſtruggle, and take it ill! There is an envying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes againſt the <hi>Truth,</hi> that ſearches and tries, and will give us no reſt; They envyed <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron, the Saints of the Lord</hi> &amp;c. The heart is unruly and unſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and its life is torn and rent from it; but this is not the giving up, not the free-will offering that God looks after; He loves a cheerful giver, and not of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint: When they offered, and would by force have made Chriſt a King, he refuſeth: and <hi>Moſes choſe afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> with the people of God; his heart choſe the thing: And if you are yet upon thoſe terms, to have a hankering mind upon honor, or eaſe, or quiet, or any ſeen things, you are not Chriſts followers: and you can never build this Ark of Salvation, unleſs you lay the foundation thus low with Chriſt; all you build (though never ſo fair and beautiful) it will not ſtand without this bottom, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there be a heart to take up the Croſs and give up your lives, unleſs you are willing to go through Hell with him. Many may abaſe themſelves to <hi>Hell;</hi> I, but they make that their <hi>Heaven;</hi> they ſay not, <hi>There is no hope:</hi> the pains of Hell are not indeed felt and endured.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:169498:98"/>
But Chriſt was brought to that pinch, that his Hope was loſt; <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me!</hi> If the Fear of God ſeize upon you, you will be jealous every ſtep you take in this work; it will put an awe upon your ſpirits, leſt you ſhould miſcarry in any thing from the pattern. How ever the words you hear from me may be rude, yet the Knowledg is ſure (ſo far as God hath led me;) and if you paſs not through the condition, [the thing ſpoke of,] I am ſure the building will not ſtand: The man that thruſt himſelf in without the <hi>wedding garment,</hi> when he was enquired into, <hi>Friend, how cameſt thou hither?</hi> he was found <hi>ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs:</hi> But thoſe that were compelled to come in, from <hi>the high-ways and hedges,</hi> they can anſwer, <q>Lord, I came hither thus, I was drawn, <hi>(None comes to me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>except the Father draw him,)</hi> I would never have come of my ſelf; I ſtood out to the laſt; and had I not been compelled and forced, I had never been here.</q> If you cannot give an account you have paſſed this way, That you have been drawn and haled to it contrary to your wills, and been made to lay down your lives with Chriſt, your building will not ſtand: This is the way God takes with his own; <hi>He turns man to deſtruction;</hi> and then he ſays, <hi>Return you chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men:</hi> He will give no other ſign but the ſign of <hi>Jonah</hi> the Prophet; and this way <hi>He</hi> paſſes, He goes down to the bottom of Hell, He cries out, <hi>I am cast out of thy ſight; and the Earth with her bars was aboue me for ever:</hi> [as if he was now quite loſt and gone;] and hence deliverance comes, but not before: And this firſt ſtory of the Ark you muſt build, [go through the <hi>Death,</hi>] if ever you think to attain the ſecond and third Stories, the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> and <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi>

                  <p>I Have been ſpeaking from theſe words all the laſt week; in which many things have been opened to you at large. I ſhewed you, how in all ages God hath had ſome, to whom he hath revealed his minde and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets: And here <hi>Noah</hi> is pick'd out for the man; of whom God thus witneſſeth; <hi>Thee onely have I found righteous in this generation;</hi> and to him he opens his counſel, what he intends to do concerning the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the World, and that <hi>the End of all fleſh was come before him.</hi> I opened to you, 1. What the Principle was he went upon, That was <hi>Faith;</hi> by <hi>Faith</hi> he did it. 2. I told you the effect it left behinde; the Word from God took place, He was <hi>warned.</hi> 3. What things was <hi>Noah</hi> warned of? Not things in preſent view, which appeared to <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Reaſon;</hi> but <hi>of things not ſeen as
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:169498:101"/>
yet:</hi> Though no danger at all could be ſeen or thought of at preſent, yet he beleeves, and is warned. Then, 4. I told you the great impreſſion it made upon his ſpirit: 'twas not a light warning, a matter of talk, (as the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of all the World is,) but it comes neer, and touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon his heart deeply; He was <hi>moved with Fear: [Work out you Salvation with Fear and Trembling;</hi> not <hi>talking,</hi> and <hi>thinking,</hi> and <hi>reſolving;</hi> but (the thing comes to the heart) <hi>with Fear and Trembling.]</hi> Then, 5. I told you what a real work this produces in him; he is not onely <hi>warned,</hi> nor onely <hi>moved with Fear;</hi> but goes on to a great work, <hi>He prepared an Ark.</hi> I told you this <hi>Ark</hi> was a Type and Figure of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> of a <hi>ſure</hi> and <hi>ſafe condition,</hi> which will carry through <hi>all ſtorms</hi> what ever: which <hi>ſure condition</hi> I told you was made up of three ſeveral works, anſwerable to the three Stories of the Ark. 1. The work of <hi>Death,</hi> of being made <hi>conformable to the Death of Chriſt,</hi> [to dye to all things both lawful and unlawful;] To let all dye, all mans reaſon, and wiſdom, and hopes, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; all created enjoyments, how dear ſoever, to part with all. 2. The ſecond ſtory of this <hi>Ark,</hi> or the ſecond work of <hi>Salvation,</hi> is the work of the <hi>Reſurrection:</hi> If <hi>by any means</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) I may attain to the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Dead;</hi> [To be raiſed again by the ſame power that raiſed up Chriſt:] Elſe if we part with all, and give our bodies to be burned, and be left there in Death, That will be miſerable: If that word of the Curſe threatned to <hi>Adam</hi> light on us, <hi>In dying thou ſhalt dye;</hi> if left in the grave, This is to be utterly loſt. Many have been brought to that ſtrait, that they could not keep alive their own Souls, had no ways to turn from the ſtroak: <hi>Cain</hi> was brought to this, <hi>Saul</hi> brought to this, <hi>Judas</hi> brought to this:
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:169498:102"/>
I, but here lay their miſery; they were <hi>left in Hell,</hi> they <hi>dyed</hi> in <hi>dying,</hi> and never came to the <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> 3. The Ark is not yet fully built, the work of Salvation not yet compleat, till it is made conformable to the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion of Christ into his glory,</hi> to be accepted there of his <hi>Father,</hi> and for ever ſetled in an <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to dye more. And in this laſt Story of Salvation I opened three things to you: 1. That the Soul is here <hi>taken up</hi> (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſays) <hi>into the third Heaven:</hi> It is quite tranſlated, and ſeparated, and divided from all ſeen things, [the whole World,] nothing toucheth it below. 2. Here the Soul <hi>heareth words ſpoke to it which cannot b uttered:</hi> Here the <hi>ſeven-ſealed Book</hi> is opened, and the <hi>eternal Decrees</hi> read; <hi>This is my beloved Son, &amp;c.</hi> 3. Here the Soul is <hi>marryed to Christ,</hi> joyned into the <hi>union with the Divinity;</hi> the Holy Ghoſt put in it, <hi>as a well of living waters, ſpringing up to eternal Life:</hi> And this is that <hi>long Life</hi> ſpoke of; <hi>He asked Life of thee, and thou gaveſt him a</hi> LONG LIFE, <hi>for ever and ever:</hi> This is that <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> never to dye more. Now ſuch a condition may be, of having <hi>Life,</hi> but not <hi>the eternal Life;</hi> they may dye again: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis ſaid of ſome, <hi>Twice dead, plucked up by the roots:</hi> Therefore the Ark is not compleat, the condition not fully ſure and ſafe, till the Soul be ſetled in the <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life,</hi> (as Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples,) <hi>And I give unto them Eternal Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then I ſpake to you of the proportions, how the Ark was to be made; <hi>the length of it three hundred cubits, the bredth fifty cubits, and the height</hi> (yet leſs) but <hi>thirty cubits:</hi> All which was not without a farther meaning.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It was <hi>three hundred cubits long,</hi> pointing out the <hi>long Life,</hi> the <hi>eternal Life,</hi> that all have which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:169498:102"/>
this ſafe condition; a <hi>long walk,</hi> from Eternity to Eternity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But yet the <hi>bredth</hi> is not ſo large, that but <hi>fifty cubits;</hi> not ſo large a compaſs here in this Life, not ſuch full room and liberty to walk round about without any ſtraitneſs; not ſo <hi>to run the ways of his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> to go on without let and controul. But,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>height</hi> leſs ſtill, that but <hi>thirty cubits;</hi> to ſhew, how the Soul is greatly kept down there; it can have leaſt room of all upwards: The Ark is but low, but little liberty Heaven-ward; the Soul when it hath attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moſt, yet it cries out, <hi>O how ſhort am I!</hi> and this is to pinch it on ſtill, not to ſit down here, but to cry for the <hi>Kingdom to come,</hi> when all bonds and ſtops ſhall be taken out of the way, and a river of broad ſtreams be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; [everyways liberty enough:] but now ever &amp; anon <hi>darkneſs</hi> and <hi>miſts</hi> riſe up, an <hi>earthly cloud</hi> gets between the Soul and its Happineſs, that it can ſee but a little way off: But <hi>then</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) ſhall I know as I am known.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then I told you, this Ark was to be <hi>pitched within and without,</hi> to keep out all waters; which pointed out the <hi>exceeding firmneſs</hi> and <hi>ſafety</hi> of a <hi>good condition,</hi> That who ever builds ſuch an Ark, (is ſo conformed to the Death of Chriſt, and attained to his Reſurrection, and aſcended, and eſtabliſhed in the ſame Inheritance, made <hi>a coheir with Chriſt in his glory;</hi>) nothing can ever ſhake this condition; no waters can get in, 'tis ſo ſurely pitched round: no doubtings nor fears can take place, either from within or without, to ſhake it: It is <hi>built upon the rock, and the gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then the Ark was to be <hi>finiſhed in a Cubit,</hi> which had this meaning, That the nearer and higher we come towards God, our way will grow more <hi>ſtrait</hi> and <hi>nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</hi> They came out of <hi>Egypt</hi> full-handed, with Dough

on their ſhoulders, and rings on their hands, &amp;c. but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they enter into <hi>Canaan,</hi> all that <hi>traſh</hi> that came out of <hi>Egypt</hi> was ſpent; their compaſs was narrower: Therefore the Cryer cries, <hi>Make ſtreight paths for our God,</hi> &amp;c. But yet, I told you, there was ſome compaſs left; it was finiſhed in a <hi>Cubits bredth,</hi> not an Inch, not without any <hi>bredth at all;</hi> No: All our Fathers have had ſome flaw or other here, their Ark hath had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in it, like to this world: They have had ſome ſore and weak part; ſome <hi>Canaanites</hi> left behind to afflict and vex their Souls: And this was to put them to a ſtrait, to cry for the <hi>Kingdom to come,</hi> where no ſpot nor wrinkle ſhalt be left, nothing of <hi>ſin</hi> or <hi>imperfection;</hi> but <hi>all tears wiped away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then I told you, this Ark contained the whole <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in it; All creatures were here to be preſerved, both <hi>clean</hi> and <hi>unclean:</hi> And this man would never chuſe, to have theſe <hi>contrary beings</hi> live ſo near together. If the ſoul be once in the <hi>Miniſtry of circumciſion,</hi> with <hi>Peter,</hi> then it would by no means touch any thing <hi>common or unclean:</hi> But the Promiſe is, That <hi>the Lion and the Lamb, and the Ox and the Bear ſhall lie down together, and yet do no hurt in all the holy Mountain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet obſerve, there is a difference made; but <hi>two of a ſort</hi> of all the <hi>unclean</hi> were to be kept, but of all the <hi>clean ſeven couple,</hi> which had this in it, to ſhew, That however here <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> dwell together in the Ark, yet there are more for us then againſt us: Seven couple of the clean ſort [a compleat number of the <hi>righteous ſeed;</hi>] and but ſome <hi>few reliques of ſin;</hi> yet a ſpawn lives, to keep the Soul in awe always, leſt it ſhould increaſe and multiply, and that there might ever be a crying out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this <hi>Body of Death;</hi> for 'tis a <hi>weariſom condition</hi> at beſt, and <hi>full of ſnares:</hi> Theſe unclean Beaſts cannot
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:169498:103"/>
but be ill companions for the clean, having always a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring mind if it were poſſible to deſtroy them.</p>
                  <p>Then in this Ark <hi>Noah</hi> had a <hi>Dove</hi> to ſend out, to bring tydings to him how it went abroad, which had this meaning in it, That who ever have indeed built this Ark, [attained to a certain eſtate of Salvation,] the <hi>Holy Ghoſt is given them,</hi> to go to God for them in all ſtraits. <hi>We know not how to pray, but the Spirit it ſelf helpeth our infirmities:</hi> This is the Meſſenger between God and the Soul in all ſtraits and diſtreſſes. <hi>What time as I am afflicted</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) I will pray unto thee.</hi> O Lord, if you had but a heart to conſider it! When your houſe is on fire, and the Enemies at hand, when you are compaſſed about with fears, and miſeries, and diſtreſſes (as you will be) and yet no <hi>Meſſenger</hi> is at hand to ſend to enquire of God, and know his meaning, and what he intends, and what the end ſhall be: O how miſerable is it to be left alone without this Comforter! There are many that ſet themſelves to pray, and ſpeak words, but alas he hears not any for their much babbling, if there be not this <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt</hi> that <hi>proceeded from him,</hi> to <hi>go to him;</hi> He hears not other cries and noyſes: Though they howl on their beds, and abaſe themſelves to Hell, he matters not. The Father will hear none but his own Spirit, and that knows how to get nigh him, to hold him faſt, and plead with him: <hi>I will not let thee go, unleſs thou bleſs me.</hi> And if this <hi>Dove</hi> return once without the <hi>Olive branch,</hi> yet it hath no reſt, but goes out again, till it obtain a bleſſing, and bring tydings of Peace. Now can any of you anſwer that queſtion of <hi>Peters, Have you received this Holy Ghoſt after you believed?</hi> You have believed indeed (I know,) and it lives in your Conſciences, that <hi>Truth</hi> is here, and God is amongſt us, that here are <hi>the words of eternal life:</hi> But now haſt thou received the Holy Ghoſt
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:169498:104"/>
after this believing? Elſe what a <hi>miſerable plunge</hi> muſt thou needs be at when ſtraits and Tryals come as thick as Hail, and thou haſt none to ſend to God to enquire the meaning, none to intercede for thee, and plead thy Cauſe; but art left (as the whole world) to live in darkneſs, and judg all things like beaſts, which know no farther then they feel in all that befalls them.</p>
                  <p>Now I would proceed to ſpeak of the Conſequents or Effects which follow this building of the Ark, and they are layd down in the words to be theſe three.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. <hi>Noah</hi> did it, <hi>to the ſaving of his houſe.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>He condemned the world by it.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. <hi>He became Heir of the Righteouſneſs which is by Faith.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>He ſaved his houſe by it;</hi> it is worth noting: It is not ſaid He did it to the <hi>ſaving himſelf,</hi> though that was included in it; yet a farther thing was in it, to <hi>ſave his houſe.</hi> The ſervants of God in all times have had that reward of their labor, to <hi>ſave a People;</hi> That hath been their care and work, to ſeek up the loſt ſheep, to turn others to Righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>And in this ſaving of his houſhold, three Things are conſiderable, How <hi>Noah</hi> did it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He ſaved his <hi>houſe,</hi> (that great work,) by <hi>being a Hearer firſt himſelf:</hi> He was firſt warned of God himſelf, and had an ear open to receive and <hi>learn the leſſon</hi> before he can <hi>teach his houſe. What I received of the Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) that I delivered to you.</hi> Many go to <hi>teach others,</hi> and were never <hi>taught themſelves:</hi> Alas, how can their work ſtand! They preach they know not what, nor to whom; They would be <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Law, not knowing the things whereof they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm:</hi> They never <hi>heard his voyce at any time, nor ſaw his ſhape,</hi> (as Chriſt ſaid to the Jews;) and how can they
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:169498:104"/>
ſave a People? They are <hi>blind Leaders of the blind;</hi> and therefore wo to the <hi>Preachers</hi> that have not firſt learn'd of the Lord themſelves; and woe to the People that are left to ſuch Guides; for both the wall and the Dawber ſhall fall together. But <hi>Noah</hi> was firſt warned of God himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He ſaves his <hi>houſe,</hi> by <hi>taking charge of them,</hi> and ſtanding engaged for them as for his own Soul. <hi>Take heed</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) of the flock, of whom the Holy Ghoſt hath made you Overſeers.</hi> The Holy Ghoſt lays the <hi>charge</hi> upon Gods Miniſters, and they are made to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, and wait, and tend, and look after their People, as <hi>their own Souls:</hi> As <hi>Judah</hi> ſaith of <hi>Benjamin, If I bring him not back again to thee, let me bear the blame for ever:</hi> Such a <hi>weighty charge</hi> they take upon them. But where is now in our days ſuch a <hi>Noah,</hi> ſuch a <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of Righteouſneſs?</hi> Many Preach indeed, and they take the charge of a People, as they ſay; but how long? Till another hundred pound a year comes, and then they are gone; or till ſome ſuffering and hardſhip or inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience come, and then they are gone: They fly at the ſight of the Wolf. O wicked generation, God will find them out! But <hi>Noah</hi> takes <hi>charge</hi> of his People; they are his <hi>houſe,</hi> his <hi>family,</hi> his <hi>life,</hi> and therefore ſticks to the ſaving of them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That is the third thing, He ſticks cloſe to them, and follows on till the thing be done, till he hath indeed <hi>ſaved them,</hi> till brought them into the ſame condition with himſelf: He will <hi>lay down his life for his ſheep;</hi> and this is a true Shepherd indeed, that cries out with <hi>Moſes, Nay rather blot my name out of the Book of Life, then that this People ſhould be deſtroyed:</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> he is at a ſtrait, and <hi>could wiſh himſelf accurst from Chriſt for his Brethrens ſake.</hi> Now to have ſuch
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:169498:105"/>
a <hi>Saviour</hi> to ſtand in the gap, to travel for a People, and never leave till Chriſt be formed in them, this is the great Mercy, and after this ſort do the <hi>Noahs</hi> in all Ages ſave the People committed to them. <hi>Moſes</hi> he ſtands up in the gap, and the anger is turned away: <hi>Phinehas</hi> he ſtands up and the Plague ceaſed: <hi>David</hi> he ſtands up and takes the ſin and the blow upon himſelf, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.17. <hi>It is even I that have ſinned and done evill, but as for theſe ſheep what have they done? Let thine hand be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me I pray thee, &amp;c.</hi> Thus he ſtands up till the deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Angel puts up his ſword, till the thing be done he requeſts for: and thus <hi>Noah</hi> and all the preachers of righteouſneſs prepare an Ark to the ſaving of their Houſe [the people committed to them].</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Another Conſequent upon <hi>Noahs</hi> building an Ark, is this, <hi>by which he condemned the world:</hi> all the world is condemned by it and that in theſe ſeven particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Noah beleeves Gods Word and is Warned,</hi> God tels him <q>
                        <hi>Noah,</hi> all fleſh hath corrupted his way, and it repenteth me I have made man, wherefore their end is come before me, and I will ſurely bring a Deluge to deſtroy them all; now therefore look to it, ſtay not in all the plain; get away from the tents of theſe wicked men; haſten and build an Ark to keep off the danger, that thou periſh not with them; <hi>and he believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God,</hi> 'tis ſaid, &amp;c.</q> But who will beleeve this report now? if <hi>God Himſelf</hi> ſhould ſpeak or an <hi>Angell</hi> from Heaven, if <hi>one from the dead</hi> ſhould come, we would not beleeve, if we beleeve not <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets. Now who will beleeve, if ſuch a <hi>certain</hi> word as this be witneſſed to them? <q>Well, deceive not your ſelves I can <hi>ſurely</hi> tell you from God, that miſery and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is certainly coming on, if you ſtick in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:169498:105"/>
if you get not an Ark, a ſure ſhelter and refuge, aſtrong Tower to flye to, you will never be able to ſtand, therefore, <hi>Knowing the terrors of the Lord we perſwade you;</hi> lay the thing to heart, defer it no longer.</q> I, but who will be warned by all this? none of the world will, the world within us and the world without, that will go on its old way, do and ſay what you can; <hi>Charme the charmer never ſo wiſely the Blackmore will not change his skin, nor the Leopard his ſpots;</hi> this carnall and ſenſuall and Deviliſh mind within us, it wil yet feed on carrion; though it be a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times warned, it will not be warned; though it be told, and told, and told, <q>Well, this way will ſurely undo you, if you ſtick on any ſeen things, and come not to give up all, and lay down your lives, you will certainly be miſerable and looſe your lives:</q> yet this ſpirit in us will not beleeve, but it will put the evill day far off, and mock at the making of an Ark. It will plead, what need is there of this ado? and God he is merciful: one ſhift or other, this world will ever finde to be at eaſe, but <hi>wo to them that are at eaſe in Syon &amp;c. Noah</hi> he is warned; [the new <hi>Heart,</hi> the ſenſible <hi>Spirit,</hi> that heares the Word and ſtands alwayes in awe and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, that is <hi>warned,</hi>] and this is that which Judges the world, for they are not.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Noah</hi> beleeves though he be warned <hi>of things not ſeen as yet,</hi> he diſputes not with fleſh and blood about the matter, but beleeves, and this condemns the world: who would not argue? <q>But what ſhall we have if we leave all? and what need is there of it yet, till more danger appears? who would build an Ark, when no flood is ſeen?</q> and not ſay with <hi>Job,</hi> No, I am well, <hi>I ſhall dye in my nest?</hi> who that is ſtrong, and in health, and hath all enjoyments about him, will then beleeve
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:169498:106"/>
a <hi>change</hi> will come? Who breaks through all ſnares and entanglements, and ſays, <q>Let me go, ſtand aſide, all is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, all may ſoon be taken from me; this <hi>life</hi> is a mortal life, and all my enjoyments are nothing if the Deluge come; therefore ſtrive not to comfort me, let me go about the work, to prepare an Ark?</q> Who breaks through thus reſolvedly? No, the heart ſtands rather to diſpute, <hi>Sure this man ſays he knows not what, there's no ſuch danger:</hi> And thus the time is reaſoned out. And if you will ſtand thus pleading, till the Flood come una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, and take you; yet <hi>remember I have told you theſe things;</hi> I have dealt truly in warning you: And (as Chriſt ſaith) <hi>all this have I ſaid that you might be ſaved.</hi> But yet you are diſputing and reaſoning, Alas! what can I do to help my ſelf? And thus we linger and come to nothing: Sure all this which I ſpeak to you, is as a Tale that is told. Lord, how I feel the hardneſs of your heart, and that the Word enters not into the ſtone! But ſure it is, if the <hi>Word</hi> take no place, the <hi>Blow</hi> ſhall; the Flood will come, and deſtroy this world.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He condemns the world in this, <hi>He ſets to build an Ark alone:</hi> He ſtays not for great and wiſe ones to joyn with him in the work, but builds alone, though all ſcoff and ſay, <q>
                        <hi>What will this Babbler</hi> ſay? what is this fool doing? Will he bring in <hi>new Laws and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi> and go contrary to all Cuſtoms, and Orders, and Rules of our Fathers, and Leaders, and wiſe ones?</q> Well, but this moves him not. <hi>Do ye what you will,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Joſhuah,) I and my houſe will ſerve the Lord:</hi> I muſt go on, ſaith <hi>Noah.</hi> The Soul that is indeed at a ſtrait, muſt go through all Lets, and ſet upon the work: It muſt leave all Relations, Father, and Mother, and Friends, and ſay to all, If you will not go with me, I muſt leave you: <hi>Let the dead bury their dead, but follow thou me;</hi>
                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:169498:106"/>
(ſaith Chriſt.) But this is the pleading of all the world; Do any of the great ones, the <hi>Scribes and Phariſees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve on him?</hi> Do the Minſters and godly Divines go this way? And here they ſit down, ſaying, We'l not be wiſer then all men, but follow our Teachers. <q>Well, ſaith the Soul that is indeed at a ſtrait, <hi>Go they as they will, yet I muſt go this way;</hi> there is a <hi>preſs within,</hi> I know not what ſhall become of me; and 'tis time now to look out: if neither Father nor Brother, if none in the World will joyn with me, yet I muſt go to <hi>Zion:</hi> Alaſs, I am at a ſtrait! Alaſs, what ſhall become of me in the latter end!</q> This ſtrait will ſurely come upon your ſpirits, and run through all enjoyments; your eating and drinking, and buying and ſelling, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall give you reſt: And were you indeed here, you would not ſtay for company; you would look out for bread to eat, were you ready to ſtarve. And who ever is thus preſſed on through all, to build this Ark, he condemns the World, who all ſit down at eaſe: And thus that <hi>world in us</hi> is condemned by that <hi>reſtleſs ſpirit of Truth,</hi> that is always reaching, and crying, and preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forward.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This condemns the World, That <hi>Noah</hi> builds an <hi>Ark,</hi> a <hi>whole Ark,</hi> not a piece of one: Now the beſt of the World, how do they ſit down contented, if they get but a <hi>broken board</hi> or two, or a ſorry <hi>cock-boat!</hi> They think all is ſafe then: I, but when the ſtorms come, and the rain beats, where is the Cock-boat then? Will that ſecure them, and be a compleat ſhelter? Many are contented with <hi>a ſo far ſaving;</hi> they are not the ſame they were, they are not like this <hi>Publican:</hi> they have eſcaped ſome of <hi>the pollutions of the world through luſt,</hi> and this they judg enough: Now, <hi>Soul, take thine caſe:</hi> No, but this will not do:
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:169498:107"/>
What if a people be <hi>ſaved out of Egypt,</hi> and yet <hi>periſh in the Wilderneſs?</hi> And if there be a <hi>ſaving</hi> through the <hi>red Sea,</hi> yet if the Soul enter not into <hi>Canaan,</hi> if it fall ſhort of Salvation, if it be not <hi>ſaved to the utmoſt;</hi> what will come of all? Men preach much againſt <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi> for holding there can be no perfect Aſſurance in this Life; but the beſt Faith is Doubting: And in effect our Divines all hold the ſame Doctrine; They ſay, that in the beſt there may be fears and doubtings concerning their conditions in times of deſertion and tryals: But it is not ſo; for had they ever been ſaved to the utmoſt, they ſhould never doubt that work more. If the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition be indeed once <hi>made ſure,</hi> it is ſo without all doubts and ſcruples; 'tis clear and unqueſtionable, and can never be ſhaken in <hi>that point</hi> more; <hi>The gates of Hell cannot prevail againſt it.</hi> And this ſure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable work of <hi>Truth</hi> is that which will condemn the World: If the Lord count you worthy to be the people to reſt no where ſhort, till the Ark be compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly built, and a ſure condition of life attained; [not to ſettle on flaſhes, nor true ſtirrings of ſpirit, nor operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; not to reſt in a <hi>half Salvation,</hi> but to be <hi>ſaved throughout, to the utmoſt;</hi>] That wil judg and condemn the World. You may go far, and be mighty in ſhew, get a high neſt, and reach to the clouds; but <hi>Lucifer</hi> muſt come from his Throne, and go down to the Pit: God ſaith of <hi>Iſhmael, He ſhall be great alſo; He ſhall beget twelve Princes:</hi> [This <hi>fleſh</hi> brings forth great and high births,] but yet it ſhall not be heir with <hi>Iſaac;</hi> it ſhall not enter and inherit Life: Though it may <hi>fare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly,</hi> and be <hi>clothed in ſcarlet,</hi> yet a time of dying comes, and then this rich man is found in Hell. <hi>How many ſervants in my Fathers houſe</hi> (ſaith the Prodigal) <hi>have bread enough, and to ſpare?</hi> I, but the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:169498:107"/>
is not their own: <hi>The ſervant abides not in the houſe for ever.</hi> Therefore, what ſhall I ſay to warn you? As the <hi>Martyr</hi> (Biſhop <hi>Latimer</hi>) ſaid, being to preach from thoſe words, <hi>Beware of Covetouſneſs;</hi> If I ſhould do nothing but repeat over this Text an hour together, it were preaching enough (ſaid he) to them that could hear: So if whole days and weeks I ſhould onely warn you of this; <q>
                        <hi>Take heed,</hi> be ſure you ſit no where ſhort of the mountain; reſt no where till you have an Ark built, a <hi>ſafe condition</hi> to ſtick to in all ſtorms:</q> All this warning would be little enough to warn you.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have ſpoke ſomething of the Effects following upon <hi>Noah's</hi> building the Ark: 1. He <hi>ſaves his houſe:</hi> 2. <hi>Condemns the World</hi> thereby. And I told you he condemned it in ſeven Particulars, four of which I have ſpoke to; the other are yet behinde. 1. He condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the World, in taking Gods Word and being warned: The wiſe man foreſees an evil, and hides himſelf: but this <hi>carnal, ſenſual,</hi> and <hi>deviliſh ſpirit,</hi> this <hi>World</hi> in us, and out of us, will never be warned, till it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. 2. He beleeves concerning <hi>things not ſeen;</hi> He diſputes not with fleſh and blood, as all the World do: Even children can plead, <q>Alaſs, I am young and childiſh, what can be expected from me?</q> The ſtrong plead, <q>Why, no need of ſuch haſte, I may live long. And others plead, 'Sure God is not ſo extream; He is merciful, and will paſs by failings:</q> And thus all the World ſhift it off till the <hi>Deluge</hi> come. And how hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath it gone with ſome of the people of God becauſe of this lingering and diſputing ſpirit! <hi>Moſes</hi> reaſons and reaſons, till the <hi>anger</hi> is kindled againſt him; and <hi>Lot</hi> lingers in <hi>Sodom</hi> till he is almoſt in the burning: and thus dangerouſly have we ventured to diſpute and reaſon, till
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:169498:108"/>
our Day may be over; and then wo to us! 3. He begins this work <hi>alone,</hi> though there be not one to joyn with him in it: and the Soul that is truly ſenſible of its want, and is indeed at a ſtrait, That muſt look out for help: if none will go with it, to cry for a certainty, What ſhall become of them? yet <hi>that</hi> muſt; That muſt have bread, or it ſtarves. So the blinde man, he cries and cries after Chriſt, and rebuke him who will, yet there's no ſtopping of his mouth till the cry be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. And this condemns the World; they are for company, they follow the wiſe and learned, go with the multitude; but alaſs, it never was, that the great ones and wiſe ones of the World were the Followers of Chriſt! not whole <hi>Colledges</hi> and <hi>Congregations;</hi> No: The Prophets of <hi>Balaam</hi> are four hundred and fifty, they go by Troops; but onely one poor deſpiſed <hi>Micaiah</hi> for the Lord, and he never prophecied good to <hi>Ahab,</hi> but evil; This true <hi>Spirit</hi> is the Troubler of the World, and judges them: <hi>nothings</hi> and vanities will content them, but this cries for <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> for bread indeed; it looks after an <hi>Ark,</hi> a <hi>certain condition,</hi> and nothing leſs will ſerve it. 4. He condemns the World, in that he builds a compleat Ark, [ceaſes not till the work of Salvation be gone through with, and finiſhed;] till the Soul be conformed to the <hi>Death of Chriſt,</hi> and to the <hi>Reſurrection of Chriſt,</hi> and to the <hi>Aſcenſion of Chriſt;</hi> till the Soul be brought to know the heart and counſels of God concerning it. Now the World are contented with halves, with piece-meals, with ſome broken ſcraps belonging to Salvation, but have not <hi>the thing it ſelf,</hi> are not ſaved <hi>to the utmoſt:</hi> They cry for Parts, and Light into Scriptures, and enlargements, and peace of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and eaſe; and they have their peny they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed for, God gives it them; but this will not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:169498:108"/>
the <hi>Noahs,</hi> [nothing but an <hi>Ark.</hi>]</p>
                  <p n="5">5. This condemns the World, That <hi>Noah</hi> builds an Ark, and <hi>pitcheth it within and without;</hi> a ſure ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that not the leaſt water can ſoak into it. Now as all the World, and all their Miniſters can never reach to this, but ſome creviſe is open, ſome flaw ſticks to the beſt conditions, where queſtionings and doubtings will get in, do what they can: And this cuts them to the heart, That no other condition ſhould be approved of, and paſs for good and ſafe, but that which is thus <hi>pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within and without;</hi> That which will ſtand in the fire, and live in the water; That which nothing can ſhake. But ſo far as the Salvation hath wrought a work indeed, the Soul can ſay with <hi>David, Though the Earth be moved, and the Mountains caſt into the midſt of the Sea, yet in this will I be confident, &amp;c.</hi> So far as I am ſaved, I am ſaved: <hi>Death, where's thy ſting? Hell, where's thy victory?</hi> This condemns and judges the World, That this <hi>Ark</hi> takes in no water; That there ſhould be no ſtaggering in the Soul, but like Mount <hi>Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> which cannot be moved: <hi>Wilt thou ſtill hold thine integrity?</hi> (ſaid that curſed Wife:) I, ſays <hi>Job,</hi> till <hi>I dye, I will not give up my integrity.</hi> But the man (be he who he will, be he never ſo wiſe, bold, and reſolute to carry it out) who hath not this Aſſurance by a ſure and tryed work in his Soul (I dare lay down my life for it) there are times of ſtaggerings and doubtings within, calling his condition in queſtion, do what he can. Let him <hi>nail his god</hi> never ſo faſt, yet <hi>Dagon</hi> muſt fall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Ark;</hi> ſome ſearching word of Truth will get in between the joynts of the cloſeſt armor, and <hi>pierce their confidence,</hi> do what they can.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Noah</hi> condemns the World in this, That though he be ſafe in the Ark, and hath attained a ſure refuge
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:169498:109"/>
from the Flood, yet this ſatisfies him not; he is not at reſt yet, but ſends forth the <hi>Dove</hi> to enquire about the abatement of the waters. There is a condition beyond a ſure and ſafe condition; when Chriſt himſelf (the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour) is to <hi>deliver up the Kingdom to the Father;</hi> when He promiſes to <hi>pray the Father to ſend them</hi> AN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OTHER COMFORTER, <hi>the Spirit of Truth, to abide with them for ever:</hi> And this is that <hi>Dove,</hi> which the Soul can now ſend forth to carry out its requeſts to God, and bring tydings from him: And this is that which condemns the World, That they have no ſuch intercourſe with God; they have no ſuch Spirit gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to make their requeſts known by: Though they may cut themſelves, and cry aloud, <hi>O Baal ſave us!</hi> yet no Anſwer comes: there is not this Dove which <hi>Noah</hi> ſends forth, that can bring an Olive branch of Peace in its mouth, and give a ſure intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence that the waters are abated, [that the wrath is ceaſed.]</p>
                  <p n="7">7. He condemns the World by the real work of <hi>ſaving his houſe;</hi> He prepared an Ark to that purpoſe, to ſave his houſe; and it did the thing intended, He did <hi>ſave them:</hi> And this judges all the World, who though they build much, yet they ſave none; <hi>The wall and the dawber fall together:</hi> They flee from their ſheep when the Wolf comes, and leave their eggs in the duſt like the <hi>Oſtrich:</hi> But <hi>Noah</hi> did the thing, he <hi>did ſave his houſe;</hi> He left them not in the mid way, till he brings them into the Ark: He travels, and is pained in Soul, till Chriſt be formed in them: This is <hi>that Interpreter, one of a thouſand, that can ſhew to man his righteouſneſs,</hi> and never leaves till that be done; and this condemns the World: That ſenſual and deviliſh part will never endure thus to ſtick to the work, to cleave to a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:169498:109"/>
through all gainſayings, oppoſings and ill requitals. Many can preach, ſo long as they may have honor, and gain, and be well thought of; but now take away their Money, or croſs their Wills, let them be deſpiſed and diſhonored, and they can preſently be gone, and leave their people, and rid their hands of trouble: ſo that they will ſtick to none farther then they can ſerve themſelves, and their own ends; and thus nothing comes of their preaching: They bring their people to nothing in the concluſion. I have known ſome Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters my ſelf, that have been preaching theſe thirty years, and not a man converted by them: What a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable caſe is this! But alaſs, they were never taught themſelves, and how can they teach others? But the <hi>Noahs</hi> they have a charge given them over their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they cannot get from them ſo eaſily: <hi>You ſhall not ſee my face unleſs your youngest Brother be with you,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Joſeph:</hi>) They muſt not leave a hoof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde that belongs to <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Such a charge as this is layd upon me concerning ſome of your Souls, That if you fall ſhort, I ſhall bear the blame for ever: The blood will be required at my hand, if I deal not faithfully, and bring you home, if you are not ſaved to the utmoſt. But the encouragement to me, is, That ſome have gone through this work: <hi>Noah</hi> did <hi>ſave his houſe,</hi> his labor was not in vain; and the Promiſe to Chriſt is, <hi>He ſhall ſee of the travel of his Soul, and be ſatisfied. Noah</hi> is rewarded for his many years labor, He <hi>ſaves his houſe:</hi> And if the Lord would pleaſe (after all my twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years Travel and Preaching) but to give me a People that might indeed build this <hi>Ark,</hi> and attain to a ſure knowledge of their Eternal Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That they ſhall <hi>LIVE FOR EVER;</hi> It
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:169498:110"/>
would requite me for all: if ſome of you might come forth thus to be Judges of the World, and build ſuch an Ark of <hi>Truth,</hi> as that all the <hi>Dagons,</hi> and Idol-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips of the World, muſt fall before it.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. The third Effect that follows this building of the Ark, is this; <hi>He became an Heir of the Righteouſneſs which is by Faith.</hi> And about this, three things may be conſidered.</p>

                     <p>It is a very large Inheritance; it is to enjoy the Lord, to be joyned and made one Spirit with him; <hi>The Lord is my portion</hi> (ſaith <hi>David:</hi>) [The Lord is my lot, my refuge, the lifter up of my head;] This is a wonderful large Inheritance!

                     <p>He <hi>became Heir of the Righteouſneſs which is by</hi> FAITH: He came to it by beleeving; That is the way how this Portion is made over to <hi>all the Noahs,</hi> even by <hi>Faith:</hi> Though it belongs to them before, yet they enjoy but as they receive; and they receive as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve: <hi>Be it unto thee according to thy Faith.</hi> They begin but with a little flock, a little beleeving; <hi>O ye of little Faith!</hi> (ſaith Chriſt;) but a <hi>ſmall grain of muſtard-ſeed:</hi> A little Faith to ſet up with, and that too of <hi>things not yet ſeen,</hi> things out of ſight, out of hand: and yet, by improving this little, how doth it grow and grow, and ſpread to a large Tree? What en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe comes of it? It leaves not growing, till it brings up the Soul, and joyns it in, to God himſelf; till <hi>Noah</hi> is made <hi>an Heir of Righteouſneſs:</hi> And therefore, O Lord, that you were but brought to ſtick to this ſmall beginning! to beleeve the word of Prophecy which is gone forth concerning you! How might it grow and encreaſe to a mighty and large Portion?</p>
                     <p>I have thus ſpoke many and great things to you from theſe words; but the Sum of all hath been to this purpoſe:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To ſhew, how ſhort you yet are; where you lie and ſtick in the mire, and have no Ark to receive you; know not what ſhall become of you in the latter end.</p>

and Security as may hold out in a Deluge; ſuch a ſure, certain, and unqueſtionable eſtate, as may ſtand in all ſtorms, and judg all the falſe ways and rotten ſhelters of the World. And now, if the Lord ſeize not the thing upon your hearts, but it ſlip off like water (as many words do) then I know you will have no peace in your own conſciences, and you will never be Judges of the World, nor come to Honor: <hi>Noah</hi> was moved with Fear to the building of an Ark; but now if that will not do it, if Fear move not; yet, Will not ſuch an Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſuch a ſecurity move you, as may be attained to? There is a ſure place, there is a Reſt, there is a way of Wiſdom, which no fowl hath ſeen, where no ravenous beaſt deſtroys, which nothing can reach nor diſturb; The Lord ſeize it home upon your hearts to conſider it.</p>

who are not, to be this <hi>choſen Generation.</hi> It is not whom man approves, but whom the Lord approves.</p>
                  <p>It was once ſo, That all lay in the confuſed <hi>Chaos</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in one lump, like the Potters clay, and then there was no difference at all; none could ſay, This is accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or this rejected; this is <hi>Jacob,</hi> or this <hi>Eſau;</hi> this a <hi>veſſel of honor,</hi> That of <hi>diſhonor;</hi> till the Potter hath ſeparated and diſtinguiſhed his clay to ſeveral purpoſes; and then was the <hi>Portion</hi> of the <hi>Nations</hi> divided, and then <hi>the Lords People became his portion:</hi> Then this <hi>choſen Generation</hi> had their firſt Being, and were both from the <hi>womb of the morning.</hi>

                  <p>Now in chooſing, theſe ſeveral things are conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Before a man chooſeth any thing, he weighs well, and conſiders, and overlooks it <hi>in his minde;</hi> He weighs all the flaws and all the perfections in it, that he may know what he chooſeth, and not do it hoodwinked: So the Lord was pleaſed to weigh all his creatures; <hi>When he divided to the Nations their Inheritance, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the ſons of Adam,</hi> then he ſaid, <hi>Jacob is my por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> He knew what he did, how he would prove; as God ſays, <hi>I knew thou wouldſt have iron ſinews, and a brazen brow:</hi> He throughly conſidered what he did, took in all faults and provocations that ſhould ever ſpring from them; and yet he pitches on this <hi>choſen generation;</hi> and yet <hi>Jacob is the lot of his Inheritance.</hi> Hence it is there are no repentings in God, becauſe the thing was throughly weighed: We often repent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of our heady ruſhing upon this, and the other; but God is not as man, He made his choyce with full ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and counſel: Hence it is, <hi>The gifts and calling of God are without repentance;</hi> And, <hi>In him is no variableneſs, nor ſhadow of change:</hi> becauſe all his works were done
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:169498:114"/>
in counſel, therefore they ſtand faſt for ever and ever: And therefore (ſaith <hi>David) Walk about Zion; Mark well her Towers, &amp;c.</hi> Conſider her ſtrength, [the ſure unmovable Rock ſhe ſtands upon;] <hi>For this God is our God for ever and ever; He will be our Guide unto Death.</hi> This God is <hi>Zions</hi> God, that hath done things at a certainty (not at hazard,) that will be a Guide un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Death; that will never leave nor forſake: The bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom and ground is certain, and 'tis expreſſed thus in the <hi>Proverbs; That I may make thee underſtand the words of Certainty.</hi> This choyce of God is a certain, unfail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, unchangeable choyce: This will ſeem wonderful when you ſhall come to conſider it, and the thing ſink to your hearts: <q>Wert thou once in the ſame lump with the <hi>reprobate ſilver?</hi> Was <hi>Eſau Jacobs</hi> Brother, and <hi>Jacob</hi> loved, and <hi>Eſau</hi> hated? How comes this thing about? What means this favor? What manner of Love is this?</q> O Lord, if it did but ſink into your Souls, what a thing is it to be <hi>choſen of God! Let not the wiſe man glory in his wiſdom, nor the ſtrong man in his ſtrength, nor the rich man in his riches:</hi> This is not the thing which puts the difference. And (ſo Chriſt to his Diſciples,) <hi>Rejoyce not that Devils are ſubject to you;</hi> That is not your Happineſs: No; but <hi>that your names are written in Heaven;</hi> that you are of this <hi>choſen generation;</hi> that God pitched upon you: what ever you are, rejoyce in that. <hi>Samuel</hi> he looks upon <hi>Eliah</hi> becauſe of his ſtature and goodly perſonage, as if ſure he was the Lords anointed: No, but ſaith God, not He; but it is the ſtripling, the little youth in the field, the youngeſt and unthought of, <hi>David,</hi> he is the man.

theſe eighteen years?</hi> She muſt be looſed becauſe a <hi>Daughter of Abraham,</hi> [of that ſtock,] how ever mean and baſe in the eyes of man; for <hi>God ſees not as man ſeeth:</hi> He picks where he pleaſeth, one of a City, and two of a Tribe: <hi>Though Iſrael be as the ſand of the Sea, yet but a remnant ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Though there be <hi>threeſcore Queens, and fourſcore Concubines,</hi> yet <hi>My Beloved is but one, &amp;c.</hi> That he ſhould let thouſands and ten thouſands go, and yet <hi>pitch on me;</hi> this will be wonderful to us, when we ſhall ſee into it!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A man <hi>affects</hi> the thing he chooſeth; his heart goes after it more then that which he lets alone: And therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> The Lord choſe you not becauſe you were better, or more in number, then other people; but becauſe <hi>He favored you, and ſet his Love upon you.</hi> And in <hi>Jeremy</hi> he ſays, <hi>I have loved thee of old with an everlaſting Love; and when thou waſt in thy blood,</hi> (one would think that a ſtrange time to love in,) <hi>yet then was thy time the time of Love:</hi> Though there was no cauſe, yet he loves: <hi>Even ſo, O Father</hi> (ſaith Chriſt,) <hi>for ſo it pleaſed thee.</hi> Two in a womb, two in a mill, two in the ſame condition, and the one taken, and the other left: To be <hi>left</hi> is enough, there is need of no more <hi>reprobation</hi> then that: If a man be but left, and not dayly maintained, kept up, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, he will corrupt of himſelf, and run naturally to deſtruction: There is no need of a curſing or deſtroying any Creature, but he is pleaſed to leave ſome, and that is enough: They naturally tend and fall into the curſe, and bring it on their own heads, if a preventer ſtep not in: and therefore that is not firſt concluded in God concerning any, This is a <hi>damned wretch,</hi> whom I hate and deteſt; No: <hi>his damnation is of himſelf;</hi> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures his own curſe: and if he be but left, if not held
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:169498:115"/>
up, and hedged in, and kept alive, he cannot but dye. No man can keep alive his own Soul. The Branch if it be left without Sap from the root muſt needs dye. If the Lord hath not choſen nor ſet his love upon any, that is <hi>deſtruction</hi> enough, that creature will ſure enough run thither; therefore ſee, how <hi>Eſau</hi> firſt <hi>ſells his birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,</hi> then <hi>loſes his Bleſſing,</hi> and one miſery follows another, till he be quite ruined: and therefore the choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, the ſetting his heart upon any, that is the thing which ſaves. (If God ſay) as <hi>Sampſon</hi> did concerning <hi>Delilah, Give me her, for ſhe pleaſeth me;</hi> be ſhe what ſhe will, <hi>yet ſhe pleaſeth me:</hi> ſo Chriſt ſaith of the Spouſe, <hi>Thou haſt raviſhed my heart with one of thine eyes:</hi> that is the thing, to be <hi>beloved,</hi> to <hi>find favour</hi> in his eyes. <hi>Love</hi> will bear all things, <hi>Love</hi> is as ſtrong as death, <hi>Love</hi> will ſave to the utmoſt, and this Lot fal's on ſome. Though <hi>Eſther</hi> be an unlikely maiden, one of another Country, of mean degree; yet <hi>ſhe pleaſed the King, and obtained kindneſſe of him,</hi> Chap. 2.9. and verſ. 17. <hi>and the King loved Eſther a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all the women, and ſhe obtained grace and favour in his ſight,</hi> and this is the thing that brings the Crown to her, be ſhe what ſhe will, <hi>Thou art fair my Love, my undefiled.</hi> Though ſhe complains, <hi>I am black;</hi> yet he loveth her, and Love ſees no faults, ſhe is comely in his eye, this is the portion of the <hi>choſen Generation.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. What a man chooſeth to himſelf, He <hi>taketh it out from other things,</hi> he gathers it near to himſelf: Thus is it with God, He pulls the <hi>Brand out of the burning;</hi> He takes the <hi>Poor</hi> out of the <hi>Dunghill,</hi> leaves them not there; and this is a ſure token of chooſing indeed, where he leaves not a man or woman in their darkneſs, in their bonds, in their ſnares, but pulls them out, <hi>ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates the Wheat from the chaff;</hi> who hath <hi>tranſlated

us out of darkneſs into the Kingdome of his dear Son,</hi> and in the <hi>Revelation</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>they were redeemed to God from amongſt men,</hi> and Chriſt ſaith, <hi>becauſe I have choſen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you:</hi> He takes his choſen ones, <hi>out</hi> of their chains, <hi>out</hi> of their filth, out of a periſhing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, cuts them <hi>off</hi> from the <hi>old ſtock.</hi> That which he intends for a <hi>veſſell of honour,</hi> he takes it <hi>out of the Lump,</hi> he leaves not his own in the ſame Lump with the rude world. Now this is the great thing to be conſidered, whether you are yet thus pulled out? hath he made thee indeed to differ from the rude world? art thou pulled out of the old Kingdome of Sathan, where the whole world dwell in wickedneſſe, though in ſeverall ranks, forms and degrees, yet in the ſame Kingdome ſtill, not <hi>a new Creation</hi> made, but this will make it appear, he chooſeth thee, if thou canſt ſay with <hi>David, He plucked my feet out of the Snare, he brought me up from the nethermoſt Hell:</hi> and ſaith <hi>Jonah yet haſt thou brought up my life from corruption O Lord, my God,</hi> that is his Salvation; there it appears, <hi>God is God.</hi> We would vainly promiſe our ſelves, (as the whole world do) to be <hi>ſaved by his love onely,</hi> and ſo quietly paſſe our Lives in our own wills here, and go to Heaven when we die; but alas, if ever ſaved, we muſt be taken out of the condition we ſtick in. <hi>Come out from amongſt them my people that ye partake not of her Plagues.</hi> Many have great words, and great knowledge and light, I, but they are not yet tranſlated out of the old Kingdom, they remain ſtill on the ſame ſtock, but things that are choſen, are taken out of the midſt of other things, and therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks to <hi>Iſrael, Was ever ſuch a thing known, as that God ſhould go to take to himſelf a people out of the midst of another people, by great ſignes

Now there is a <hi>reſtleſs spirit</hi> in the <hi>Cains,</hi> and loſt ones, but that is onely <hi>out of Torment,</hi> the worm that never dyes, and this reſtleſs ſpirit never moves towards God, but runs from him: but to this Centre the <hi>spirit of life</hi> ever tends, to come <hi>from,</hi> and <hi>out</hi> of, all things <hi>unto</hi> God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Things that are choſen have no <hi>hand in their own choice,</hi> All that befalls this <hi>Choſen Generation</hi> is of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and free goodneſs: who made thee to differ? no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing they could do, could ever make a difference; but the Caſe ſtands thus, Two things lie together, and a man paſſing by, takes one and lets the other lie: the things have no hand in it; ſo is it in this choice of God, all is done <hi>according to the pleaſure of his own will:</hi> ſee and read as you go, that you may have nothing to glory and boaſt in, nor challenge the leaſt to thy ſelf, as if he ſaw ſome readineſs, or activity, or towardlineſs in thee more then in others: no, he ſaw nothing but his own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: if there be any thing good in thee, he put it there: <hi>you have not choſen me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>but I have choſen you:</hi> This will make it appear free indeed, when you ſhall be made to ſee there is no hand of yours in it, but

                     <hi>of his own good will begat he us.</hi> No man ever begun firſt to ſeek after God, but, <hi>I was found of them that ſought me not,</hi> elſe no Soul would ever be ſaved: Can a ſtone move upward? no, nothing can <hi>move to God,</hi> but what <hi>came from God;</hi> none can go to Heaven, but the <hi>Son of man,</hi> which <hi>came down from Heaven:</hi> It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to man, who is born from beneath, from the Earth, to move upward, his Centre is below; unleſs he be pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and drawn, and born up, and carried upon Eagles wings, he falls to the Earth like a ſtone; the natural man cannot pleaſe God, he neither will nor can be ſubject to the Law of God, and this is, that God may have the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry alone in the work of Salvation, as he ſays in <hi>Iſa. It ſhall be to me for a name, and for a praiſe:</hi> That he ſhould ſave ſuch unlikely ones, and <hi>out of ſtones raiſe up chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to Abraham,</hi> this will ſeem wonderfull: <hi>I did not think to have ſeen the Lord here,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Hagar</hi>) when ſhe had given up all for loſt: this will make the Soul ſay indeed, as <hi>David</hi> doth, <hi>God alone doth all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Things that are choſen are <hi>ſet apart for ſome ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all uſe;</hi> a man hath ſome end in chooſing them: ſo was it with God in this choice, he had a peculiar end and deſign to bring about, and he chooſeth ſome for that purpoſe: but why are not all the world for this uſe? True, they might have been, had he put in them the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, had he fitted the veſſel to that purpoſe, but he ſpends a great deal of coſt and pains upon ſome, he prepares the Veſſell for that very purpoſe to put in <hi>new wine; Old Bottles</hi> would break preſently, they were not intended for that uſe: You ſee <hi>Saul</hi> had of this <hi>wine</hi> in him, he was <hi>among the Prophets,</hi> the <hi>ſpirit of God was upon him,</hi> but the Veſſel broke, and all ran out, and was loſt: ſo <hi>Judas</hi> he was a Preacher, and went in, and out, with Chriſt, and had enjoyments and ſeaſons of <hi>Truth,</hi> but
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:169498:117"/>
the veſſell had holes, and all was loſt, and came to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and therefore it is ſaid of ſome, that <hi>they make ſhipwrack of faith, and a good Conſcience:</hi> All is ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and broken, and gone as if it never had been, ſome are compared <hi>to the Corn that grows on the houſe top;</hi> though it be green and flouriſhing, yet ſoon withers and comes to nothing; It was ſown there by ſome chance, or carried by ſome fowl, the Husbandman never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have a Crop from thence: ſo may it be, and hath been, with many that are very green, they have Light and Knowledge, and parts, and Forwardneſs, I, but they grow upon the houſe top, the place was not intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for that purpoſe to bear a Crop; the ſtony ground flouriſhed for a time, but ſoon dies for want of root, <hi>ye did run well,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) but they were left, and ſoon turned aſide, but now whoever is pitched upon by God, and made a choſen veſſel, he is ſet apart for ſome end ſome ſervice: <hi>ſay ye</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>the Maſter hath need of him;</hi> and he ſpeaks to <hi>Ananias</hi> concerning <hi>Paul, He is a choſen veſſel, to carry forth my name:</hi> whoever of you are thus choſen, and pickt and gathered by God out of the world, out of relations, and all your ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; Do you think God hath no end in it?

Things that are choſen, men expect more from them, then from other refuſe, they leave behind; A man when he is hungry chooſeth bread and not a ſtone, and he looks for more refreſhment, and nouriſhment from that, then he would from a ſtone, God expects not to <hi>gather grapes of thorns;</hi> he looks not to <hi>reap,</hi> where he <hi>never ſowed,</hi> the unjuſt Servant accuſed him falſly in that, but if he pleaſe to take advantage he may, he may come in

an hour unthought of, as Chriſt came to the <hi>Fig tree,</hi> and curſed it, becauſe no fruit was on it, though it is ſaid, <hi>it was not the time of fruit,</hi> it ſeems ſtrange, but ſuch a Lord is he, if he will take the advantage, if he will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream to mark what is done amiſſe, then who may ſtand? He can (if he pleaſe) caſt a man into ſickneſs, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of body, or let looſe horrours upon his Soul, there is cauſe and advantage enough to be taken, if he will make a man an example, a witneſs of his power and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, (for the Goſpel hath that in it too, it is to be preacht for a <hi>witneſs to all,</hi> as well, as for <hi>Salvation to ſome</hi>) but now from <hi>his own,</hi> his <hi>Choſen Generation,</hi> He expects ſomewhat out of Love: <hi>If I be a Father, where is my Honour?</hi> he expects fruit from you, he looks for ſweet grapes from his <hi>Vine,</hi> he expects you ſhould hear (Sure they are my people, they'l be orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and perſwaded, and prevailed with) he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects better entertainment from them, then from the world, and though it falls out, that they are the <hi>chief of Sinners,</hi> and found the moſt ill requiting of all People, I, but it is their ſhame, and their ſorrow, and their Sin; he looks for other fruit; he looks for more, where he truſts with more, where he truſts with <hi>Heavenly Treaſure, I ſayd, They are my People, Children that will not lye,</hi> and in all things he <hi>expects their moderation</hi> that at all times they ſtand open and ready to receive him; that alwayes <hi>their Lamps be burning,</hi> and their Loyns girt, as thoſe that expect their Lords coming, and he is grieved if they diſapoint him, therefore, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, <hi>The Ox knows his Owner and the Aſſe his Maſters Crib, but Iſrael doth not know, my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple doth not conſider:</hi> This grieves him to be thus dealt with at their hands.</p>

                     <pb n="214" facs="tcp:169498:118"/>7. Things that are choſen, are more looked after, and more carefully minded then other things; they are not layd ſcattering about, but charily reſerved: So doth the Lord deal with his choſen; He takes them <hi>into his boſom,</hi> hides them under the <hi>ſhadow of his wings, (Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in the ſight of the Lord is the death of his Saints,)</hi> and if their Death be precious, if an eye after them then, <hi>in their blood;</hi> if the <hi>minſtration of condemnation be glorious;</hi> if there be <hi>Love</hi> in that work of bringing to <hi>Death;</hi> Then how much more <hi>Love</hi> will be ſeen in bringing them again to <hi>Life?</hi> He ſays of his Vineyard, that He <hi>watches it night and day:</hi> And in the <hi>Canticles, My Vineyard, which is mine, is continually before me:</hi> There is no time he watches it not; <hi>night</hi> and <hi>day</hi> take in all: In the <hi>Light</hi> and in the <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> in their <hi>ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows</hi> and in their <hi>enlargements,</hi> ſtill he watches: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſleep or wake, yet <hi>the Keeper of Iſrael neither ſlumbers, nor ſleeps:</hi> If they are ſent into captivity, it is for their good, (there his eye is after them:) If the <hi>three children</hi> are caſt into the <hi>furnace,</hi> there is a <hi>fourth</hi> like <hi>the Son of God,</hi> He will walk with them there: If <hi>Daniel</hi> be caſt into <hi>the Den of Lions,</hi> his God is there to <hi>ſhut the Lions mouths.</hi> If <hi>Joſeph</hi> be ſold into <hi>Egypt,</hi> God goes with him; if he be caſt into priſon, he is with him there, and findes favor for him: where ever theſe choſen go, a ſpecial eye is after them: when they wander from one Nation to another, from one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to another People; yet there, <hi>He ſuffers no man to do them harm,</hi> but <hi>reproves even Kings for their ſakes: Touch not mine anointed &amp;c.</hi> His charge is given out to ſecure them; a guard is ſet about them that nothing may harm them: <hi>He ſhall give his Angels charge over thee, and they ſhall preſerve thee in all thy ways:</hi> This is his care of his choſen, and this is their ſafety and happineſs.

Before I come to make Uſe of this, I would ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the next words, <hi>A Royal Prieſthood:</hi> This <hi>choſen Generation</hi> is intended for that, to be a <hi>Royal Prieſthood,</hi> to offer up Prayers and Praiſes to God: <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>you have asked nothing in my Name,</hi> becauſe as yet they were not brought to beleeve the words of Chriſt: They knew not they were a <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Generation,</hi> till at the laſt, when he was about to leave them, then he ſays to God, <hi>And theſe have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved that thou hast ſent me:</hi> There is no coming to your <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> till you are firſt brought to know and beleeve you are a <hi>Choſen Generation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A ROYAL PRIESTHOOD; <hi>Royal,] of the royal Blood, born of God, ſprung from that ſtock and kindred.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And hence three great Priviledges belong to them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They can go to God as thoſe that have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in him; they go as to a <hi>Father,</hi> and not as to a <hi>Judg:</hi> The Promiſe is to Chriſt (and ſo to all the ſeed,) He ſhall ſay, <hi>My Father, My Father;</hi> and Chriſt ſays to his Diſciples, who were of this <hi>Royal Priesthood,</hi> when you pray, ſay, <hi>Our Father:</hi> All muſt go to him as <hi>our Lord,</hi> and bow before their <hi>Judg;</hi> but they have an intereſt in him, as being of that <hi>royal race,</hi> ſprung out of his own heart and bowels; and if you had but the knowledg of your intereſt in this <hi>Father,</hi> certainly you could not hold your Peace, you could not be kept off from going and making your requeſts known to him: <hi>If thou hadst known</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to the woman) <hi>the gift of God, thou wouldst have asked of him waters of Life.</hi> You could not but pray, and tell him your wants, and griefs, and ſorrows: for you may go to him on this ground, <hi>He is my Father.</hi> O that you did but know, and weigh, and conſider, whether indeed your lot be fallen in ſo good a ground! We would be taught to
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:169498:119"/>
pray any ways, rather then to pray thus, <hi>Our Father;</hi> as the Diſciples ask of Chriſt, <hi>Teach us to pray:</hi> but how? as <hi>John taught his Diſciples:</hi> Why, how was that? <hi>John</hi> could ſhew his Diſciples their wants, their miſery, their undoneneſs; and <hi>John</hi> could point to the <hi>Lamb of God,</hi> That <hi>this is He which takes away the ſins of the World:</hi> [That relief was onely to be had and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected there:] But <hi>John</hi> could not tell them, <hi>This is your portion, God is your Father,</hi> All this is for you: No; This is the <hi>witneſs which Chriſt is to bear forth, which is greater then the witneſs of John;</hi> He tells them, <hi>It is your Fathers good pleaſure to give you the Kingdom:</hi> And again, <hi>The Father himſelf loveth you:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he teaches them to pray thus, <hi>Our Father.</hi> But how long were they before brought to ask any thing in <hi>this name!</hi> ſuch a wretched unwillingneſs is in the heart of man, indeed to know, or come to its own good.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This <hi>Royal Prieſthood</hi> have this Priviledg from their intereſt in God, They may <hi>go freely,</hi> and <hi>with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> to the <hi>Throne of Grace;</hi> no need of ſtrangeneſs or ſtraitneſs on Gods part: <hi>You are not ſtraitened in us</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) but you are ſtraitened in your own bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els;</hi> That is all the cauſe indeed: But <hi>John</hi> was bold, He could ſay, <hi>And truly our fellowſhip is with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and with his Son Jeſus Christ;</hi> His company was no lower, nor meaner: And it is ſaid of our fathers, how they <hi>walked with God,</hi> and were <hi>the friends of God:</hi> They had a <hi>boldneſs</hi> to go in to him at all times, in all caſes of need: when found <hi>Sinners,</hi> yet then they can pray, <hi>O cleanſe my heart; O waſh me, and I ſhall be whiter then ſnow.</hi> When found <hi>ignorant,</hi> yet pray ſtil, <hi>O grant me underſtanding, and I ſhall live; Teach me in the way that I ſhould walk: O guide me, and teach me, &amp;c.</hi> He is <hi>bold</hi> to go to God in the <hi>worſt day,</hi> in
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:169498:119"/>
the loweſt time; yet he hath no whither elſe to betake him: and here the door ſtands open always, <hi>Come unto me ye that are heavy laden, &amp;c.</hi> When his ſins go over his head, as a burthen too heavy to bear; yet whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther carries he his burthen but to God? Where ſpreads <hi>Hezekiah</hi> the <hi>Letter,</hi> full of railings, and threatenings, and reproaches, but <hi>before the Lord?</hi> As children, though they have never ſo greatly offended, yet, when all comes to all, have no whither elſe to go, but ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther home to their <hi>Fathers houſe.</hi> Though <hi>Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom</hi> had ſlain his Brother, and highly offended the King his Father, yet nothing will content him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he may <hi>ſee the Kings face:</hi> ſo nothing can ſtay the Soul, or keep it back, though it have dealt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo unkindly with the Lord Chriſt, though it hath <hi>crucified,</hi> and killed this Brother: yet it muſt <hi>come in to its Father,</hi> and own its ſin, and ſee the Kings face, and cannot reſt, till He ſmile again, and take it into favor, that it may be <hi>free</hi> and <hi>bold</hi> with Him, as formerly.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another Priviledg of this <hi>Royal Prieſthood,</hi> is, That as they have an Intereſt in God, and boldneſs to him; ſo they are ſure to prevail with him in the things they ask: <hi>I know</hi> (ſaith <hi>Martha</hi> to Chriſt) <hi>what ever thou askeſt of God, he will give it thee:</hi> nothing elſe will ſtop the cry of this child; it will ask and ask till it do prevail: Though called <hi>Dog,</hi> and put off once and again, yet ſhe follows on ſtill, and will not leave, till at laſt ſhe gets this Anſwer, <hi>O woman, great is thy Faith! Be it unto thee as thou wilt.</hi> There is no deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this <hi>Royal Prieſthood</hi> the thing they are at a ſtrait for: They will never from his door till he ariſe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge his Elect. There is a wonderful ſympathy that runs in the worſt of times, that cannot give over; but ſtill
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:169498:120"/>
the cry is, <hi>My God, my God, why hath thou forſaken me?</hi> All muſt ſtoop to <hi>the Lord, the God;</hi> but <hi>my God</hi> ſtill: <hi>Though he kill me, yet will I truſt in him:</hi> And therefore what need is there, and what great advantage might be to you, to know you are of this <hi>Royal Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi> to whom theſe <hi>Priviledges</hi> belong! That you might ſtep into the <hi>Prieſts Office,</hi> and begin to pray; for <hi>He will deny no good thing to them that love him;</hi> or rather (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) that are <hi>loved of him.</hi> Though the Lions may want, and ſuffer hunger; though the great and high ones of the World may come to ſtraits, and cry and cry, and no <hi>Baal</hi> will anſwer them; yet <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi> is heard: The Lord deals not ſo with this <hi>Royal Prieſthood;</hi> He will deny them no manner of good thing.</p>
                  <p>Now, if it were the Lords Will, I deſire that I might interpret the riddle to you, that you might read the Parable, and be your own witneſſes, That <hi>God is in you of a Truth.</hi> I have told you, you are a <hi>Choſen Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> and are to be a <hi>Royal Prieſthood;</hi> and how ever there be in us a ſtrange unnatural warring againſt it, yet (as Chriſt ſaith) <hi>It is your Fathers good pleaſure to give you the Kingdom:</hi> He hath pleaſed to tye himſelf in ſuch a bond of neerneſs, as nothing can ſeparate. But I would yet come neerer and cloſer to you, that you may know more clearly how to judg of the matter, and ſee the bounds of diſtinction that are ſet between this <hi>choſen generation</hi> and all other whatſoever: For as it is certain the <hi>Hypocrite</hi> will never be without Hope, ſay and do what you can; yet he will ſcramble and ſteal ſomething to lean on and truſt to: So the <hi>ſons of God</hi> are as much on the other hand; it is as hard to pull and draw them up to beleeve and hope, as to keep the others back: They muſt be overpowered to it; They requite ſign upon

                  <p n="1">1. In this <hi>Choſen Generation,</hi> there is a certain <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inſtinct of a cloſe,</hi> when ever God and the Truth ſown in their Souls come to meet: when they come but neer one another, there is a natural turning, and cleaving together: The Loadſtone and the Iron never meet, but they cloſe and feel one another, and gather neerer and neerer. Now examine if it be not thus with you, where ever you meet with a <hi>living breath</hi> from the <hi>Lord,</hi> doth it not touch ſomething in you? Doth it not turn and ſtrike the heart? and cauſe a ſtrange na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural cloſe in your ſpirits? When Chriſt put but his finger in at the hole of the door, the Spouſes bowels were turned preſently; 'Tis not ſo to other Lovers. The Loadſtone will not cleave to all metals, nor to wood and ſtraws, though you gild them never ſo fairly. Now all the reſt of the World are taken here; They all wonder after the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> when it hath any <hi>likeneſs of the Lamb</hi> upon it; they cannot know <hi>Wolves</hi> in <hi>ſheeps clothing:</hi> They take down all good words, and earneſt deſires, and hope, and love, and zeal, that ſpeaks for God: They are taken with ſhadows and pictures, and cannot diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between words and words, voyce and voyce; Their <hi>gods</hi> have no breath paſs through their throat; they <hi>live</hi> not, to diſcern, and diſtinguiſh, and divide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween things and things; all that hath the <hi>ſame ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,</hi> to them paſſes for the <hi>ſame thing:</hi> but <hi>my ſheep know my voyce</hi> (ſaith Chriſt;) That touches them, <hi>and the

voyce of ſtrangers they will not hear:</hi> Where this <hi>cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Generation</hi> is, there is a certain diſtinguiſhing, reliſh, and taſte; <hi>Doth not my ear taſte words</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job?</hi>) Nothing will pleaſe nor take this <hi>Truth</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is ſown in any) but its own kinde, and there it naturally cleaves and cloſeth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You ſhall know this <hi>Choſen Generation</hi> by this, They can <hi>finde no reſt for the ſole of their foot,</hi> no place where to <hi>lay their head:</hi> Though they run, and hunt never ſo about and about for <hi>eaſe</hi> and <hi>reſt,</hi> yet they can finde none; They are certainly diſappointed and wearyed out of all things: All they come neer cries out to them (as the Lepers of old) <hi>unclean, unclean;</hi> Come not to me, I cannot ſatisfie: The <hi>Earth</hi> ſays, <hi>It is not in me;</hi> and the <hi>Sea, It is not in me:</hi> They can ſit down no where, but the ſtool is pulled from under them, and they haſted up to their journey, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p Elijah, why fitteſt thou here?</hi> Every thing their hearts would pitch on, is made either <hi>too hot,</hi> or <hi>too heavy,</hi> for them to carry; either we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not carry our <hi>luſts,</hi> they have ſo much lumber and luggage belong to them; or elſe they are too hot, and burn our hands; the thorns are too ſharp: it is too hard to <hi>kick againſt the pricks:</hi> Therefore I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſaid, of all people in the World, it is in vain for <hi>thoſe</hi> that <hi>belong to God</hi> to go about to <hi>pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi> in any luſt; for they ſhall be ſure to be hunted out. Others may enjoy their wills, and ſit down in ſin, and take content in the Creatures; their eyes may ſwell with fatneſs, they may have their hearts deſire: I, but the <hi>Davids</hi> may not: <hi>I am chaſtened every morning, and plagued every moment:</hi> They have no reſt in this World, but are always like <hi>ſtrangers</hi> and <hi>Pilgrims;</hi> though weary and tired, yet alaſs!
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:169498:121"/>
they muſt not take up till they come home! All grows weariſom and tireſom to their Souls; nothing can eaſe, nothing quiet, nothing ſatisfie nor fill up their want, no pleaſure, nor enjoyment: If I ſay, <hi>My Bed ſhall comfort me,</hi> yet there he is met with, and affrighted: If <hi>I go up to Heaven,</hi> or <hi>down to Hell,</hi> or <hi>fly to the utmoſt parts of the Earth;</hi> yet no where can he ſit down for eaſe, but <hi>this ſpirit findes him out;</hi> he can finde reſt and ſatisfaction no where. <hi>Job</hi> hunts through all places, and ſearches the perfections of the choyceſt Creatures; he findes the place of <hi>Gold,</hi> and a place for <hi>Silver,</hi> a place for <hi>Pearls</hi> and <hi>Treaſures;</hi> but yet all this is too ſhort for the want: where is the place of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> ſtill? He had tryed all things, and yet findes them want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Now many through idleneſs ſit ſtill, and will not take the pains to hunt thus; they will not try whether the Creatures can content them or not: but (ſaith <hi>David) I have ſeen an end of all perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> I ſee that all things come to an end: When all means, and ways, and plots are proved out to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, yet then the Soul is weary of all its <hi>labors,</hi> and cries out, <hi>Ye are all Phyſicians of no value, you cannot help me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. By this you ſhall know the <hi>Choſen Generation;</hi> God is their <hi>utmoſt,</hi> their utmoſt Hope, utmoſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, the utmoſt thing of all his People: but he is not the <hi>utmoſt</hi> of others; they follow Chriſt but for loaves: ſome baſe <hi>ſelfiſh thing</hi> or other is their <hi>highest:</hi> If they may have but what their hearts run after, they could ſit ſhort of God well enough: Give them eaſe, give them peace of Conſcience, give them Knowledg, and great enlargements of ſpirit, and they have enough; This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents them. I, but this <hi>Choſen Generation,</hi> give them
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:169498:122"/>
what you will, nor Gifts, nor Parts, nor Enjoyments of the World, nor enlargements of <hi>Truth,</hi> no not <hi>Heaven</hi> it ſelf; to be <hi>ſaved</hi> would not be enough to them: but God is the utmoſt thing, the Center to which their Souls tend: To <hi>ſee the Kings face</hi> is their deſire; elſe what will their lives avail? And this I would propoſe to you, Whether ever any thing thou metteſt with in all thy life was enough to thee? whether it was the utmoſt thing? That thy Soul could ſit down in? No, ſure I am, nothing can ſtop the cry of this <hi>Elect;</hi> It cries night and day: when ſtraitened, and when enlarged, ſtill it cries. When <hi>Jacob</hi> had wraſtled all the night with God, and now he ſays to him, <hi>Let me go, for the day breaks;</hi> Is not that enough? Will not the day [the <hi>light</hi>] content thee? to know, and ſee, and be enlarged? No, it will not: <hi>I will not let thee go unleſs thou bleſs me:</hi> He wanted a farther bleſſing yet. I would have you weigh the thing in your own Souls, whether it be thus or no with you? and do not always ſtagger; be not faithleſs, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This is another ſign of this <hi>Choſen Generation,</hi> it always gathers and cleaves cloſeſt to them that are moſt excellent: <hi>All my delight</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) is with the Saints, and them that excel in vertue:</hi> It chooſeth to come up to the foremoſt, to the worthies of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> Now others drozel away their time without any ſuch aſpiring deſires: If they might but come to Heaven, and be ſaved at laſt, That were enough to them: They are not preſſing on to the utmoſt mark, where the bullets are thickeſt, and the battel hotteſt, as this <hi>choſen genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> do, according to that right minde that is planted in them: They long with <hi>Moſes,</hi> if poſſible, that they may go over this <hi>Jordan;</hi> they are ever crying out of their ſhortneſs: <hi>Jacob</hi> (though <hi>Pharaoh</hi> reckon him an
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:169498:122"/>
old man,) yet he complains <hi>his days were few and evil,</hi> and that he had not reached the age of his fathers in their generations: I, but he would have reached the greateſt attainment; That which is of this ſtock preſſeth to the <hi>utmoſt mark,</hi> prizeth that <hi>Truth,</hi> that <hi>friend,</hi> that deals moſt plainly, nakedly, and exactly with it; it chooſes <hi>the wounds of a friend,</hi> and goes where the ſword cuts ſharpeſt: This cannot the <hi>Hypocrite</hi> ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. This <hi>Choſen Generation</hi> have often <hi>ſtill and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret hintings</hi> ſpeaking within them, That they indeed are of this ſtock, that they do belong to God, how e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they are ſtopping the ear, and putting it off. Now the <hi>children of Hell</hi> they hunt and ſeek for ſuch a voyce, that they may be cozened and deluded; and the Devil he ſpeaks peace to them, and they are given up to <hi>beleeve a lye:</hi> but the <hi>Children of God</hi> are followed and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with ſuch a ſecret whiſpering in their Souls, that riſes up without their pumping; nay, when they run from it, it ſpeaks, Surely <hi>they are my people, they are my choſen; I will be their God:</hi> Now either we are not ſober, and ſo liſten not to hear this voyce, or elſe we wilfully ſtop the ear, and run from it, (for ſuch a baſe temper is in man againſt his own good;) or elſe through ignorance the Soul runs wrong when it doth hear; it goes to <hi>Eli,</hi> as <hi>Samuel</hi> did; it runs to this, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, to know the meaning of it, becauſe, as yet, it is ſaid, <hi>Samuel knew not the Lord;</hi> but the time comes the Lord will go on, and call, <hi>Samuel, Samuel;</hi> ſo long, till all the <hi>choſen of God,</hi> that are <hi>called ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to purpoſe,</hi> ſhall be made to hear, and own it diſtinctly, and ſay, <hi>Speak Lord, for thy ſervant heareth.</hi>

                  <p>IN the verſes before, <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of a ſtrange Caſe, which is very contrary to Reaſon to believe, or ſee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; verſ. 11. <hi>I returned, and ſaw that the race is not to the ſwift, nor the battel to the ſtrong, nor bread to the wiſe, nor yet riches to men of underſtanding, nor yet favour to men of skill: but time and chance hapneth to them all.</hi> None of theſe will carry through: by <hi>ſtrength</hi> ſhall no man prevail, and the <hi>wiſdom</hi> of this world is fooliſhneſs; and as for <hi>Riches,</hi> they make themſelves wings, and fly away. But well (ſaith <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>) though all this takes not, this Wiſdom, and ſtrength, and riches, and skill cannot deliver men; but they are taken in an evil net like the fiſhes, and ſnared like the bird; Yet for all this there is <hi>a wiſdom</hi> that will ſtand, there is a condition of deliverance to be attained. <hi>I ſaw this wiſdom under the ſun, and it ſeemed wonderful unto me. There was a little city, and few men in it;</hi> and a great King came againſt it, and beſieged it, and built Bulwarks againſt it; and yet a poor wiſe man was found in it, and he by his wiſdom delivered the City. This <hi>wiſdom</hi> is indeed wonderful, and too high for a fool.</p>
                  <p>The words in themſelves are a metaphor taken up by

the Holy Ghoſt, by which he would expreſs himſelf in things obvious to mans <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>reaſon,</hi> and humane capacity, and thereby lead the ſoul into the <hi>inviſible minde,</hi> meaning and intent of Scriptures. For there is a hidden inviſible meaning runs in all the Scriptures, which none can read, but thoſe that buy <hi>eye-ſalve</hi> of Chriſt to anoint their eyes; thoſe who are taught of God, and led into the meaning of them by the ſame Spirit which once breathed them forth. The Scriptures are a <hi>deep Well,</hi> and none but men of underſtanding can draw it out: for all others the Well is too deep, and they have nothing to draw with; they can by no means reach the inviſible minde of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>From the words, theſe things are obſervable:</p>
                  <p n="1">I. <hi>That always the Lord had a little City under the Sun.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In all times he had <hi>his people,</hi> a City built together, where his Name lived: and this was the ſtrait of all our Fathers in their day, to find <hi>this City</hi> of the living God; They ſought a City that had <hi>foundations,</hi> no other would content them. They left all other dwellings all other contents delights enjoyments (wherein the world live) chuſing rather to wander in a wilderneſs, where there was no way, till they might come to this <hi>City of habitation;</hi> they reſted in no place: no condition, nor honour, nor pleaſure could hold them, till they might come to this City, and ſit down in their <hi>own houſe. — O when ſhall I come and appear before God!</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) Though he had a ſtrong Army now with him, of the <hi>valiants of Iſrael,</hi> and they faithful and ready to venture their lives for him, through a whole hoſt, yet he is at a ſtrait for the <hi>Temple of God,</hi> for the place where the <hi>Lord dwelt,</hi> and his Name, and Power, and Truth lived.</p>

                  <p>Now in a City three things may be conſidered,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 A <hi>City</hi> is an <hi>habitable</hi> place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where many dwell: 'tis not like a waſte Forreſt, or barren Wilderneſs; but a place of concourſe and meeting of people.

Time was, when he came and went as a <hi>wayfaring</hi> man, that ſtays but for a night and is gone; (and thus he is now in many of your ſouls, he comes and goes preſently) but there is a time, and there are a people, when, and in whom, he takes up <hi>his abode<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> in whom he ſettles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> never to remove more. Though he may lie in the bottom of the ſhip, lie cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and buryed under ſorrows and tryals; yet he is ſtill there: <hi>I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee;</hi> that's the Promiſe.</p>

                     <pb n="234" facs="tcp:169498:128"/>2 A <hi>City</hi> is a place of <hi>free traffique,</hi> where men may buy and ſell freely without any moleſtation (if they are made Free of the City) trade where they will, and when, and in what they will, — Such a <hi>City</hi> hath God <hi>in his people;</hi> ſuch a freedom he hath to deal with them at his pleaſure: Sometimes he will trade in tryals and ſorrows, to bring forth the riches of the <hi>deeps beneath;</hi> ſometimes he will trade in <hi>chearings, inlargings,</hi> and <hi>revivings</hi> of Spirit. Sometimes Gold, and Silver, and Pearls come out to ſale; ſometimes Camels Hair, and blue Silk, (as he pleaſeth) but ſome trade or other is ever going on in his City. It is never left wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate; but he will be free to buy, and ſell, and trade in what ever he pleaſeth; ſuch a place as this he hath, where he is not bound in or to any thing (as we would bind and limit him to our meaſure) we will hear him ſo far, and come up to ſuch a pitch, but not a jot further: therefore, we are not <hi>this City</hi> yet; he dwells not ſo in us, (though viſits and paſſes too and fro often) for the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord cannot be bound, it will have liberty to ſtir and act at pleaſure; he will be free to binde and ſtraighten, to looſe and inlarge, to raiſe up or caſt down, as he pleaſeth (and pleaſed he is, ſometimes to run his deareſt people through wonderful ſtrange conditions and caſes to ſhew his great power, and wiſdom, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in ſtanding to, and recovering them out of all) that he may bring forth <hi>all his rich wares,</hi> and make his Name manifeſt; but he dwells not in any heart, where he hath not this freedom to trade in what he will, (ſorrows and afflictions, as well as inlargements and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments) but in his own City he is free, there he can trade in <hi>what he will,</hi> and <hi>when he will,</hi> and <hi>how he will;</hi> they always ſubmit and ſay, <hi>Not my will, but Thine;</hi> they ever juſtifie him, <hi>Good is the Word of the

                  <p n="3">3 A <hi>City</hi> is a place of <hi>ſafety</hi> and ſecurity; it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a man may be ſafe from theeves and robberies there. Such a City are the people of God to his <hi>Name,</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> and <hi>Truth;</hi> they are bound to ſecure them. It is expected by God, as <hi>Lot</hi> ſaith of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels that came to him (when the wicked <hi>Sodomites</hi> preſſed to the door to do them violence) ſee how earneſt he is, how he labours? What will he not give to ſave them out of their hands? Nay, take my two daughters, rather take all I have, onely let <hi>theſe ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers alone,</hi> diſturb not them: For, for that very cauſe came they under my roof, that they may be ſafe. Where <hi>this City</hi> is indeed, what will not the ſoul venture to keep the truth alive and ſafe, that it ſuffer not; and therefore the Church writes of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> that they were men which had <hi>hazarded their lives</hi> for the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> nay let all go, to keep this Name up. <hi>I count not my life dear</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) to finiſh this courſe with joy. Now the enemies great plot is, to kill this Name of truth, that the name of Iſrael may be no more in the earth; that the devil and all his inſtruments aim at, to deſtroy it root and branch utterly; <hi>but I have called you friends</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) therefore I can intruſt you with all my minde and counſels; you will be <hi>faithful,</hi> and <hi>not betray</hi> me, not deal as the men of <hi>Keilah,</hi> when <hi>David</hi> inquired of God, whether they would deliver him. I, they will (ſaith God) but <hi>theſe citizens</hi> will be more faithful; they will not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver up <hi>their David</hi> [their King the Lord Chriſt] they will die, rather then be falſe to the Lord. Such a <hi>City</hi> as this will God have, ſuch a people he ſeeks, that will build him a <hi>ſanctuary,</hi> where he may be ſafe out of all
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:169498:129"/>
dangers, that will (in deed, and not in word) venture their lives and all they have for his Name. Oh that your ſouls were but taken! that the deſires and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were but up in you, that you might be ſuch a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to the Lord; and ſing as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did, when deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thorow the Red-ſea, <hi>And we will build him a habitation.</hi> Oh that ſuch a minde were riſen up, though but in two or three of you; that any of you were brought forth to be ſuch a City where God might take up his <hi>abode,</hi> and be free <hi>to do his own will</hi> (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever pleaſeth him) where he might dwell <hi>ſecurely;</hi> [always a watch and faithful overſight to preſerve his Name and Truth from ſuffering:] <hi>Joſephs</hi> watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in all our ways; crying out, when tempted to any thihg that is not right, <hi>How can I do this great evil, and ſin againſt God?</hi> How can I deal falſely with my <hi>Citizen,</hi> my <hi>King,</hi> that dwells in me, and hath committed himſelf unto me? If you have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a minde to become a <hi>Citie</hi> for God to dwell in, you muſt firſt be a <hi>People compact</hi> together, and at unity in your ſelves [a perfect union and cloſe of heart] as Chriſt prays, <hi>That they may be one, as thou Father and I are one:</hi> Such a neerneſs, and freedom, and communion with God, as <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of; <hi>And truely our fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And if we come not to this point [to be ſuch a <hi>Citie</hi> to him] truely all our profeſſion, and hearing, and gathering together, all will vaniſh into nothing: Nay, better had it been the Name of the Lord had never been called upon by us then that we ſhould <hi>take his Name in vain;</hi> which will be if we come to nothing after all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in the Spirit and ſhould end in the fleſh; if make a ſhew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and profeſſion, and reſolution to ſtand to his

Truth and Name with our lives; and then (like the <hi>children of Ephraim who carried bowes</hi>) ſhall <hi>turn backs in the day of battel;</hi> this would be a <hi>taking of the Name of God in vain,</hi> if left, that any thing be too hard for us, and make us depart, and ſay, <hi>We</hi> will follow him no further.</p>
                  <p n="2">2ly. Obſerve<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> THIS CITY IS BUT A LITTLE CITY; <hi>a little one]</hi> and <hi>that</hi> may hint out theſe three Conſiderations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Little,</hi> in that it makes <hi>no great noiſe,</hi> no <hi>bulk</hi> in the world; no great notice is taken of it, (but a poor obſcure worthleſs thing it is looked upon to be;) and therefore 'tis ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>He ſhall not cry, nor lift up his voice in the ſtreets.</hi> He makes no great <hi>buſtle</hi> in the world, (by <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and <hi>reaſon,</hi> and <hi>much talking</hi> to maintain his Cauſe) but gathers to a corner amongſt a few, a deſpiſed company of <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Harlots,</hi> and <hi>blinde</hi> and <hi>lame,</hi> [the <hi>abjects</hi> of the world] and theſe he teaches, and opens the parable in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>A little city,</hi> in compare of the <hi>many great and vaſt cities of the world,</hi> that make a mighty ſhew, and take up a large compaſs. They have multitudes on their ſide: (they plead) [all the wiſe, and learned, and rational men in the world joyn with them.] I, but this will not prove you to be <hi>the little City.</hi> The <hi>whole world</hi> (it is ſaid) wondered after the Beaſt; and the <hi>whole world</hi> lies in ſin; and it is a <hi>broad way</hi> that leads to deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and <hi>many</hi> walk in it: But it is but a <hi>LITTLE CITY</hi> where God dwells; and therefore there is need to enquire into all your <hi>Preachings,</hi> and <hi>hearings,</hi> and <hi>huntings,</hi> and <hi>ſetlings</hi> down to any people abroad: <hi>Have we found the</hi> RIGHT CITY <hi>yet in all?</hi>
                     <pb n="238" facs="tcp:169498:130"/>
Men miſtake, God hath not his kingdom in this world; he hath not a multitude that will hold out to follow him, but fall, and fall away, as the multitudes that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Chriſt did, till he came even to the <hi>twelve,</hi> and asks them, What, <hi>will you alſo forſake me? Baals Prophets</hi> indeed they are many; they are three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty; I, but the <hi>Lords Prophet</hi> is onely one deſpiſed <hi>Micaiah,</hi> and he never propheſied good to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab.</hi> If you ſeek this City indeed, expect it not in a multitude. What care, and deſignes, and plots are ſpoke of, to ſettle a <hi>whole kingdom, whole Churches</hi> and Congregations in a way of truth! Alas! when all is done that can be, you can get no gold but where it is, (though you dig and dig never ſo in a wrong ſoil) there is but a <hi>remnant</hi> when all is done: <hi>Though Iſrael be as the ſand of the ſea, yet but a remnant ſhall be ſaved,</hi> [but a few] if we hang never ſo on husbands, and wives, and children, and would carry all our friends a long with us, yet alas a parting muſt come, if they be not of that little Remnant.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 A <hi>Little City,</hi> in that it is <hi>hard to be found:</hi> you muſt look wiſhly, or you'll never finde it out: you can hardly ſpy the houſes of this City, (they lye ſo low) unleſs your eyes be very good: you would never think this to be Chriſt: <hi>What, this Jeſus? The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters ſon?</hi> whoſe Father and Mother we know? Is this he? No, the world cannot find him, but two or three wiſe men that are led by a ſtar [here and there one] a <hi>Philip,</hi> a <hi>Nathanael,</hi> a <hi>Peter;</hi> they can truly ſay, <hi>We have found the Meſſias,</hi> he of whom <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote; but it is wonderful hard to ſpy him out, and therefore there is great need for you that are ſeeking this City, to be very careful where you pitch, and greatly to be jealous over your ſelves,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:169498:130"/>
and enquire again and again, that you may not be cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but meet with the true one (for 'tis wonderful hard to finde it) and therefore ſee in what a poſture the true ſeekers are, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.4. The children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the children of <hi>Judah</hi> go together with <hi>weeping and ſupplication,</hi> and <hi>aske the way to Zion,</hi> with their <hi>faces thitherward.</hi> See how they are bent to the thing, and with what fear and earneſtneſs they ſeek Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! Alas, if we finde not the true City, we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done! and the City is but <hi>Little.</hi> Many Cities in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there are in the world [<hi>Cities</hi> of <hi>ſilk,</hi> and <hi>purple,</hi> and <hi>ſcarlet;</hi> of <hi>gold,</hi> and <hi>ſilver,</hi> and all <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious wares,</hi> great <hi>hopes</hi> and <hi>confidences,</hi> and <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>knowledge,</hi> and <hi>high words,</hi> &amp;c. ſuch Cities may eaſily be ſeen and found] but if ever you finde this <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle City,</hi> you muſt have a <hi>new eye</hi> given you, ſuch a one as <hi>Moſes</hi> had, to ſee things that are <hi>inviſible;</hi> things that appear not at all here, but are a great way off, in <hi>another world,</hi> (as Chriſt ſaith) my <hi>king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is not of this world:</hi> and if you have not ſuch an eye as this given you, (ſeek, and enquire, and aske ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo long) you will never meet with the <hi>true Chriſt;</hi> for he is not eaſily found; It is not <hi>common Bread,</hi> to be had every where: you may indeed eat <hi>Manna,</hi> bread from Heaven [<hi>Powers,</hi> and <hi>enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and <hi>refreſhings</hi>] and yet die for all that; <hi>your fathers eat Manna, and are dead:</hi> but now the <hi>true bread,</hi> the <hi>bread of life,</hi> that is hard to come by: to be <hi>ſaved indeed,</hi> to the <hi>utmoſt,</hi> that is another work. Here the multitudes fall off at this <hi>hard ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Here are no full harveſts to be expected; but three or four berries on an uppermoſt bow, [a few ſcattered gleanings after harveſt, when the vintage is over] and it is wonderful hard to ſpy them out, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:169498:131"/>
it be given you to underſtand the parable, unleſs your underſtandings be opened to ſee into the Scriptures, <hi>into them]</hi> many read the <hi>letters</hi> (ſee them without) but cannot pierce into the <hi>Spirit</hi> and meaning of them. None can do this, but they to whom the new eye is given, none elſe can ever finde this City. It is ſo little a one, ſo clouded and covered over with <hi>reproaches,</hi> and <hi>ſcandals</hi> and <hi>meanneſs,</hi> 'tis ſuch a deſpiſed unthought-of thing. All the world never once dream that God is bound up in ſo <hi>little a compaſs,</hi> that he lives in ſuch a <hi>little City.</hi> They plead, Is not God <hi>everywhere?</hi> Is he not <hi>with us</hi> as well as with <hi>you?</hi> No: He is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed every where, but he is not ſeen everywhere, he is known in <hi>Zion</hi> (that little City) but all others, the great and learned of the world, ſee him not: they cannot ſee inviſibly; that's <hi>nonſenſe,</hi> they'll ſay. He is hid from the wiſe and prudent, and revealed to a few Babes. Therefore beware, and <hi>follow not a multitude to do evil:</hi> there is great need your whole ſouls and mindes ſhould be intent and taken up in this thing, (if indeed you have a minde to find it, and to live for ever) that you may take no reſt, nor give any ſleep to your eyes, nor ſlumbering to your eye-lids, till you have found out this habitation for the God of <hi>Jacob.</hi> Need there is to keep your eyes fixed, and to go weeping and mourning, and asking the way to Zion, with your faces and hearts thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therward.</p>
                  <p>And thus two things in general have been opened to you. 1 That God for certain hath <hi>his City</hi> under the Sun, his people in the world: however the whole world lie in wickedneſs, and are loſt, and run the ſeveral runs to deſtruction, yet he hath a <hi>remnant;</hi> he hath reſerved to himſelf <hi>ſeven hundred that have not

It makes no great noiſe nor ſtir in the world, (it raiſes no Armies, nor makes Tumults to defend and enlarge it ſelf.) 2.

Where Chriſt is, though the man would <hi>dye,</hi> and <hi>ſink</hi> and <hi>give up all,</hi> and again, and again, run to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing,</hi> yet he cannot, it is impoſsible to drown this truth; caſt it where you will, it will ſwim, and get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, this <hi>ſeed of Life</hi> cannot quite <hi>dye, Thou holdeſt our ſouls in Life</hi> (ſaith <hi>David:</hi>) and again, thou holdeſt me faſt <hi>behind,</hi> and <hi>before;</hi> he can get out no wayes, [he can neither <hi>promiſe</hi> himſelf <hi>deliverance,</hi> nor yet <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude deſtruction</hi>] ſuch a ſtrange bond holds the Soul: and I would now ſeriouſly enquire of ſome of you, (in whoſe ſouls the truth is) whether ever you could ſay ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly in all your lives, you were utterly cut off, and there was no hope in God for you, for as it is impoſſible to bring up others to this cloſe cleaving, and hanging upon truth (though they ſeem never ſo high, and confident, and <hi>nail their God</hi> never ſo ſure, yet he will fall) ſo impoſſible is it to kill this <hi>Spark of Life,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is; but it will hope and cleave, and look towards God, though it be in the bottom of Hell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. (as Chriſt ſaith to the Jews) <hi>If God were your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you would love me, for I came from God;</hi> ſo I ſay, if Chriſt be in thee, thou canſt not but <hi>love Chriſt,</hi> (that

                  <p n="4">4. Where Chriſt is, He is a <hi>ſearcher,</hi> he diſcovers al the inward, and ſecret workings, all the plots, and ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems of the Devil, that all are but to deſtroy, the ſoul is made to take notice of the ſecret carriages of things within, it ſees all the Train of his <hi>wyles</hi> and <hi>tricks,</hi> and <hi>inventions</hi> how they are laid, and how they work and whither they tend, the world is blinded in all, they ſee no danger, they know not whither they go, but Chriſt he is a <hi>divider</hi> in the ſouls of his People: he will not believe every good word and fair promiſe that the enemy may make; <hi>Maſter ſave thy ſelf, and cauſe theſe ſtones to be bread,</hi> no, but he will weigh and try what runs in all, he will not take all for gold that gliſters, though you ſpeak never ſo good words, and fair promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and all ſeems right, yet the Spirit of Chriſt, where it is, will try and examine whence it comes, from what root all ſpings, whether from heaven or hell? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Where Chriſt is, he <hi>will never yield up his City,</hi> though it coſt him his life, he wil ſtand to his charge what ever comes on it; as the three children anſwer, <hi>though our God ſhould not deliver us,</hi> yet (this their ſouls are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in) <hi>we will not fall down and worſhip the golden Image:</hi> what ever it coſt, yet they cannot turn to a Lie to worſhip an Idol, <hi>Though thou haſt ſore broken us in the place of Dragons, and covered us with the ſhadow of death,</hi> yet <hi>cannot we lift up our hands to a ſtrange God</hi> &amp;c. though the Soul may be taken, and carryed Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:169498:137"/>
by force, yet where Chriſt is, it ſtill breaths with <hi>Paul, but with my mind I ſerve the Law of God</hi> [I chuſe not this Service, though halled to it] it is the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then it cryes under, that is certain, it cannot go back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, though it cannot get forward neither, though made to yield and ſay well: <hi>this is your hour, and the power, of darkneſs,</hi> yet the ſoul conſents not, it will not fall down and worſhip an <hi>Idol God Jacob</hi> will not go back again to <hi>Labans</hi> ſervice, what ever comes on it, though <hi>Laban</hi> purſues behind, and <hi>Eſau</hi> meets him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>before, and God ſeems to <hi>leave</hi> and diſcouraged him, yet he will wraſtle it out with God, and never give over without the bleſſing.</p>

and ſo he ſends to deliver them with a high hand and ſtretched out arm, by ſtrange ſigns and wonders, againſt all the oppoſition and rage of their Enemies.

is made, ſo that the work ceaſed and was layd aſide, till a new ſtirring ariſes, and God ſends <hi>Haggai</hi> and other of the Prophets to put them upon it, to build this Houſe, after it had lien waſte many years, (for the people were now brought out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and dwelt in their own Land,) but they let the time ſlip and paſs over, and had no heart to the work, though they might have built it; and this is <hi>parallel to our condition,</hi> that linger and trifle away time, and put it off, though an opportunity be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us again and again, and we are often called, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited, and entreated to ſet on this work of building the <hi>Lords Houſe,</hi> [to become a one-hearted people, no more to ſerve our ſelves, but one another.]</p>

God will have a Houſe built, that there may be a <hi>certain ſet way of worſhip,</hi> a place <hi>whither the Tribes may go up,</hi> the <hi>Tribes of the Lord;</hi> that every man go not on rudely, in a conceited prepoſterous way, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the thoughts of his own heart: <hi>Thou ſhalt not worſhip in every place which thine eyes ſhall ſee,</hi> but in the place which the <hi>Lord</hi> ſhall chooſe to place his Name therein: As there is but one God, and one Truth, and one Hope; ſo he hath appointed but <hi>one way;</hi> ſet down one order and rule for all, and not left men rudely to the rangings and rovings of their own vain thoughts and conceivings, (as all the world now take up ways of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion according to their own imaginations:) but he hath a <hi>Zion,</hi> a <hi>Houſe</hi> of prayer, a <hi>Temple,</hi> where Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren live in unity, joyn with one heart and ſoul in offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpiritual ſacrifices, and there will he be found; <hi>There he hath commanded the bleſſing, and life for evermore.</hi> Why could not <hi>David</hi> worſhip God as well in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs? Was not God there? (As many now plead, Why, is not God every where? and may not we ſerve him where ever we will?) But <hi>David</hi> cries out, and is at a great ſtrait, <hi>to ſee the glory of God in the Temple,</hi> no other place would ſerve him: And why was all <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> once every year to come to this temple to worſhip?
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:169498:141"/>
What was the meaning of it, think you? You'l ſay perhaps, the <hi>Law</hi> is gone and abrogated: Well, but what was the <hi>end</hi> and <hi>ſubstance</hi> of the <hi>Law?</hi> That ſtands ſtill; Chriſt <hi>came not to deſtroy the Law, but fulfil it:</hi> to bring about the End of God, the thing typed out by the <hi>Law.</hi> Now (as 'tis ſaid of <hi>Iſrael</hi>) That <hi>the vail was upon their hearts, that they could not ſee to the end of the Law when Moſes was read:</hi> So this <hi>hidden end</hi> none can reach, but to whom God ſhall open the Parable: but this was the end the Temple pointed to, to ſhew that God then had, and ever would have, an orderly, and quiet, and ſober way of worſhip, in a people joyned together, and made up into one heart and one ſoul, and they to <hi>worſhip in ſpirit and in truth,</hi> according to his ordering and appointment, as that <hi>unction</hi> received ſhall <hi>teach,</hi> and not according to mans conceits, thoughts and imaginations.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He will have a Houſe built to be <hi>a ſpectacle and ſtanding witneſs to condemn the world by:</hi> For now, who will not ſay, that God is to be <hi>worſhipped?</hi> I, but they worſhip after their <hi>own heart and devices; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the number of their Cities, ſo are their gods,</hi> [as every one conceives, and makes a ſhape of worſhip in his own thoughts:] But who knows the minde of God in all their worſhip? Who joyns in, to <hi>this Body of Chriſt,</hi> the true Temples where the Holy Ghoſt dwells, and ſpiritual ſervices are performed to God? It is ſaid in the <hi>Acts, Of the reſt durſt none joyn, but they magnified the people;</hi> the way was too ſtrict: I, it is the greateſt Circumciſion in the world to mans will, to joyn in here, to be a member of this building; it calls for a whole giving up of a mans own wiſdom, his own will, his own intereſts; no ſtone in <hi>this Houſe</hi> muſt lie looſe from another; [no Soul live apart to it ſelf, and
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:169498:142"/>
for it ſelf, but all in love to ſerve one another:] and this will condemn all the ways and joynings of men in the worſhip of God; for they all live as <hi>Lords,</hi> love and ſeek themſelves in what ever they do; they cannot endure to come up to ſuch a joyning, and ſuch an order, where <hi>no Self may live:</hi> Though many enter into <hi>Church-orders,</hi> and <hi>Church-fellowſhip,</hi> yet alaſs, there is no true life nor ſpirit in it; they ſtill live looſe, as Lords, and Rulers, one over another; there's no walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in love, and meekneſs, and patience to ſerve others, and deny themſelves. But in this building there is a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual help and ſupply in love, every member ſays to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>I have need of thee:</hi> The foundation lies loweſt; I, but it bears up the whole building: and what would the foundation be but loſt rubbage, if not built upon, and joyned to, the reſt of the Houſe? All miniſter and help, receive and give honor to other, and ſay, <hi>For they are worthy.</hi> O the peaceable Life that is to be attained! But we are far ſhort of it, at a great diſtance from that uniting, from that ſupporting, that ſerving, that prizing, and ſeeing the need each of other. We are brought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether indeed, but live like looſe ſtones, ſcattered and alone, and prize not the mercy given us, nor make uſe of it: and this is the reaſon we proſper not, but a blaſt follows in all: we ſow much, and reap little; we labor, and ſtrive, and tug again and again, but nothing comes of it: we cannot, nor ſhall ever be able of our ſelves to withſtand the Devil, and luſts, and entanglements, till we are brought to be <hi>a one people,</hi> to receive help from one another; this is the way and ordinance of God, and here he hath commanded the bleſſing. If we were but once made <hi>naked</hi> and <hi>open-hearted</hi> to one another, in our tryals and temptations; Oh how wonderfully might we be ſtrengthened againſt the Enemy, and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:169498:142"/>
on in our way! and this would clearly condemn the world, who in their own Conſciences know they are not built up into a <hi>one-hearted people,</hi> [ſingly, and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and heartily to ſerve one another in love and peace, not ſeeking themſelves in all.] But how we linger? and the building of this Houſe is neglected? I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the motioning and ſtirring to this work was up in ſome hearts at leaſt twenty years ſince; but the <hi>Biſhops</hi> they got up, and cruſhed all the tender buddings, that the work ceaſed; and ſince this <hi>Parliament,</hi> the Lord hath graciouſly procured <hi>Liberty</hi> to be proclaimed, a door open for this work, and many have begun to build, but they prove Houſes of their own invention and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances; not <hi>the Lord Houſe:</hi> but we that are ſurely called and invited to it, and that of God, both from ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings within, and a call without, we make no uſe of the opportunity offered, but plead, <hi>It is not time to build the Lords Houſe,</hi> becauſe we have no heart to the work, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have ſhewed the Reaſons why God will have a Houſe built: 1. That there may be a ſtanding place of Worſhip, whither the Tribes may go up, where all may meet and agree together in one heart and way. <hi>Daniel,</hi> though he be in <hi>Babylon,</hi> yet opens his window, and looks towards <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in his prayers; and when they ſat by the rivers of <hi>Babylon,</hi> they wept, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred <hi>Zion:</hi> they called to minde the worſhip, the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, the ſolemn aſſemblies, where God had walked, and been ſeen, and found by them; and the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of this enforceth tears, being now deprived, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now in a ſtrange Land, out of this enjoyment. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſs! if we belong not to this City, this Habitation of God, if not a ſtone in this building, it had been good for us we had never been born, for <hi>without are Dogs.</hi>
                     <pb n="264" facs="tcp:169498:143"/>
Then again, this Houſe is to condemn the world; let men be never ſo wiſe, and ſtrict, and religious, yet if they <hi>live alone,</hi> [keep all cloſe, and live to themſelves,] the world will never be judged and convinced by this, but a ſpirit of love and union <hi>to ſerve another, and deny my own will;</hi> as 'tis ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>He pleaſed not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi> and <hi>Moſes choſe afflictions with the people of God:</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> though he was free from all, yet made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>a ſervant to all;</hi> he made himſelf a ſervant, he choſe the ſervice, it was his joy to ſerve others: And <hi>no man</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>takes my life from me, but I lay down my life for my ſheep:</hi> And if we ſhall ever be brought to this, to forſake and willingly give up all our enjoyments, and liberties, and enlargements, and chooſe afflictions, chooſe to bear anothers burthen, though I am free; when we ſhall be glad to be counted worthy to ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt; when we might have eaſe, liberty, and honor, and pleaſures, yet to ſay, <hi>Farewel all:</hi> 
                     <q>Friends, life, and liberty, farewel all, you are nothing to me; neither count I my life dear, in compare of my <hi>God,</hi> my Truth, my Brethren, that I may ſerve in this work, and help to build <hi>this houſe</hi> This, I ſay, wil condemn the world; their conſciences accuſe them, that this mind is not in them, they live not this life of love and union.</q> There are many that cry for <hi>corn,</hi> and <hi>wine,</hi> and <hi>oyl<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> [enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and flouriſhings in the Truth,] but all is for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to feed their own bellies: but all this is too ſhort; this is but fruit that may be ſhaken: a mans Soul may be loſt for all this, and the Houſe of God lie waſte. But next,</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Conſider, WHAT WILL GOD HAVE THIS HOUSE BUILT OF? WHAT ARE THE MATE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIALS OF IT? All that come are not the Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials; No: though they make a fair ſhew, though wiſe, and honorable, and great in the eyes of men, yet this is
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:169498:143"/>
not enough; this Houſe muſt be built.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Of <hi>living ſtones,</hi> ſtones that wil abide and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, not ſoon rot and putrifie: <hi>Better is a living Dog, then a dead Lion.</hi> Not every one that makes a great ſhew, and comes to hear, and ſeems forward, No, no, onely ſuch which have this <hi>ſpirit of life</hi> in them, to keep them from ſtinking and corruption, to make them <hi>last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtones,</hi> they are the materials for this houſe; all others will fall off in a day of tryal. There were many follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſt into <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when in his triumph, and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanna</hi> was ſung before him; but very few that went out of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with him, that follow him to <hi>Golgotha,</hi> to his <hi>Croſs;</hi> No, none but a few <hi>pickt and choſen ſtones</hi> that have a <hi>ſpirit of life</hi> to make them laſt and endure: no others are for this building, but ſuch as the <hi>Lord</hi> ſhall chooſe to it, whom he takes out of many; <hi>David</hi> was choſe out of all his Brethren, he was a fit ſtone for the uſe, a man after <hi>Gods own heart,</hi> he loves <hi>Truth</hi> in the <hi>inward parts;</hi> and this mind he ſees in <hi>David,</hi> and him he pitcheth on; ſuch a company of choyce ſtones will he have for this houſe, a <hi>choſen generation</hi> of laſting ſtones that may make a Tabernacle never to be pulled down more, never to be loſt; <hi>The gifts and calling of God are without repentance:</hi> ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s God chooſeth for materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of this building, are ſuch as are never to be loſt and thrown away; <hi>No man can pluck them out of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hand</hi> (ſaith Chriſt:) not ſuch a <hi>dead ſtone</hi> as <hi>Saul</hi> proved, when the ſpirit of life was taken from him, he mouldred away, and came to nothing; but <hi>living ſtones:</hi> a ſtable, enduring, and fixed ſpirited people he looks for, that are not ever hanging, and waving, and reeling to and fro in their minds; but ſuch as are tryed ſtones, and will endure the ſtorms; not like <hi>Ephraim,</hi> who being armed, and carrying Bows, yet turned their back in the day of Battel. Then,</p>

                     <pb n="266" facs="tcp:169498:144"/>2. Conſider, In this Houſe are to be veſſels of all ſorts and ſizes, ſome to hold leſs and ſome more; ſome to receive much, and to give out, and ſupply, and fill up others: He will have veſſels for every ſervice, and every uſe; none are to be barren, but all uſeful and helpful to one another: and therefore the thing is weighty, and need we ſhould conſider it, and lay it to heart; for he will not build his Houſe of any rubbage, but onely of <hi>living</hi> and <hi>tryed ſtones:</hi> And then all are to be of uſe, all the veſſels of his Houſe are for his own ſervice; they are not to be <hi>looked on,</hi> and <hi>baubled with,</hi> and <hi>made to ſerve our wills and luſts.</hi> Remember what befell the King <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> for venturing to call for the <hi>Lords</hi> veſſels to make up his mirth and jollity, the hand-writing appears on the wall, and makes him tremble. 'Tis dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous trifling in weighty matters, God will not be mocked. But next conſider,</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. WHY DO THEY PLEAD, IT IS NOT TIME TO BUILD THE LORDS HOUSE?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What Reaſons have they?</hi> Theſe three.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Their Ignorance hinders:</hi> Thence their pleadings come, It is not time to build, &amp;c They <hi>knew not</hi> that the blaſtings and Mildews, and curſe that followed them in all their wayes, was becauſe this houſe lay waſte; they were <hi>ignorant</hi> whence all this evill befell them, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired not into it, <q>Lord, what is the meaning of the hand againſt me! Why go all things thus contrary? Why proſper I not in any thing I take in hand?</q> They knew not this was the cauſe of all: <hi>Ye looked for much, and it came to little, and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it; why? ſaith the Lord of Hosts? becauſe of mine Houſe that lies waſt, and ye run every man to his own houſe,</hi> Verſ. 9. and ſo on. And this is a great block
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:169498:144"/>
in our way, <hi>our ignorance;</hi> we enquire not, why am I ſo barren and deſolate, and perplexed in all my wayes! Why goes all ſo croſs to me, &amp; I meet with nothing but troubles, and fears, and tormenting thoughts? Alas, it is becauſe we live Scattered <hi>alone,</hi> and follow our own Counſells, our own wills are our own guides, and rulers, and come not to build the Houſe of the Lord [to be counſelled and ordered, and appointed there:] Hence is all our miſery.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Love of their eaſe hindered:</hi> it was a great deal an eaſier way to ſit at home in their own <hi>ceiled houſes,</hi> then to go up to the Mountain, and cut wood down, and bring, and hew, and ſquare it to build the <hi>Lords Houſe;</hi> and who would indeed chooſe to venture to leave all, to give up all, eaſe and reſt, and peace, and enjoyments, and inſtead thereof to take up troubles, and ſorrows, and afflictions? Oh no, the heart ſhrinks from this: here comes in, <hi>Spare thy ſelf, Master;</hi> and therefore we plead it is not time yet, becauſe it is a trouble and perplexity to the man to ſet upon this work, it puts him beſide his cuſhion; he muſt be ſure, if he begin to build the Lords Houſe, to meet with oppoſition and contradictions from within, and from without, from the world, and from the Devill: The more we ſhall ſtir to get out of his Kingdom, the more will he ſtir and rage, and caſt out his floods to deſtroy: what have <hi>our Fathers</hi> gone through in this work? what ſtrange miſeries, and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry ſorts of death, as you may ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. What did <hi>Paul</hi> ſuffer? hunger, and nakedneſs, perils by ſea, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rills by Land, perils amongſt falſe brethren, ſtripes, and Impriſonments; and now who will endure this that can avoyd it? who will chooſe afflictions? Mans heart will ever plead, <hi>it is not yet time,</hi> becauſe it loves Eaſe, and would never ſee ſorrow. But</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="268" facs="tcp:169498:145"/>3. <hi>Fear hinders them:</hi> They were yet under tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the King of <hi>Babylon;</hi> they were not yet quite freed from their foes, they had once begun to build and were hindered, and curbed in the work, and therefore now fear gets up, and they will venture no more, having been once cruſhed, and ſtill remaining under the ſame e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies: this ſeems a juſt cauſe to plead, it is not time; <q>and thus the heart reaſons, Have I not tryed, again and again, and been ſtopped and prevented, and beguiled by the Enemy, and am I not ſtill in, his hands? and if I ſtir, I ſhall ſoon be met with, and pulled back again:</q> and here the heart ſlugs and lingers, and thinks it hath cauſe to fear, and keep off: but <hi>Jordan</hi> never parts, till the Prieſt firſt ventures to ſet his foot in it: there muſt be a venturing through all lets, and rubs in the way, if ever we think to come to any thing, and ſee, when they do but begin, and ſet upon the work, how they are proſpered, and all makes for them, which before might ſeem impoſſible; and are not theſe the true reaſons we keep off from the work? are we not <hi>ignorant,</hi> that this is the cauſe of all our miſery? are we not <hi>loving our eaſe?</hi> are we not <hi>fearing our enemies,</hi> and ſo give it over, and plead, it is not time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But conſider,</p>
                  <p n="5">V. WHAT MISERIES FOLLOW FOR NOT BUILDING THIS HOUſE?</p>
                  <p>A curſe and a blaſt follows in all their undertakings, do what they will, yet nothing proſpers; as it is with a man in a <hi>deep conſumption,</hi> let him eat what he will, though never ſo good and choice diet, yet his Stomack ſpoils all; It turns it into ill humours to maintain the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, till the root of his ſickneſs be taken away: and ſo is it with us, notwithſtanding all our mercies and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities afforded: meat is ſet before us daily, daily are we waited upon, and called, and inſtructed,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:169498:145"/>
and counſelled, yet how do we ſtill waſte and conſume? we thrive not in all, but wax leaner and leaner, we come and hear, and liſten ſometimes, and ſwallow down a great deal, but alas all is ſpoiled by a <hi>bad ſtomack!</hi> we ſpend all upon our Luſts, we love to <hi>live alone,</hi> by our ſelves, at our own <hi>Wills,</hi> and <hi>Counſells,</hi> and <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> we are not ſubjected, yet in our ſouls to come to build this houſe of the Lord, to live in <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell</hi> and <hi>order one with another,</hi> &amp;c. and this is the moth that eats and deſtroys, and will deſtroy all our good, if the Lord prevent not: thus I have ſpoke to you what this Houſe is, why God will h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ve it built, and of what materialls: and then the Reaſons why the people plead, it is not time, and the miſery that follow this neglect: and now in a word I would ſpeak to that, who they are that are chiefly guilty in this thing?</p>
                  <p>I cannot ſo charge you all of being thus guilty, but there are <hi>chief Heads</hi> who are called to this work, and they are to lay the firſt ſtone: the cloud muſt firſt remove before the people can journy: and in that great ſin of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſtrange wives, for which <hi>Ezra</hi> pull'd off his hair, and ſat aſtoniſhed on the ground, 'tis ſaid, the <hi>Princes and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi> they were the chief in this thing, they lead on the reſt by a bad example, they are the ſinners, ſuch as were bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to the feaſt, and yet refuſe to come, and make excuſes, <hi>they are the ſinners.</hi> Now are you all bidden &amp; called out to build this houſe? no, I know, it cannot yet touch nor lie upon all your Conſciences, that this houſe is not built, but the <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Leaders,</hi> ſuch as have been called both from a word without, and a ſtirring within their own ſpirits, to begin their work, and lead the way and lay the firſt ſtone, that the reſt might follow; theſe are the guilty perſons that make their excuſes when they are Invited, <hi>I have married a wife, I have bought a Farm,</hi>
                     <pb n="270" facs="tcp:169498:146"/>
[This and the other ſtands in my way, that I cannot come;] but if any <hi>enjoyment</hi> or <hi>imployment,</hi> or <hi>relation,</hi> if any <hi>tye</hi> ſhall hinder us from ſetting to this work, when the Lord calls to it, then are we miſerable. I know there are ſome of you that ſtand yet clear, and have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted a call, but think you are ready to become any thing that ſhall be called for from you; but ſome of you there are that punctually and certainly know you are called forth to the work, and yet draw back and ſhrink away, and ſay, <hi>'tis not yet time to build, &amp;c.</hi> The heart knowingly flies back and ſhrinks; this is the guilt, here lies the ſin: Therefore the firſt thing to be known by you, is, whether you are called or not, and if call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then take heed of reaſonings and pleadings with <hi>Moſes, I am a ſtammerer, a man of a ſlow ſpeech, and they will not beleeve that thou haſt ſent me,</hi> till at leſt the anger of the Lord was kindled for his lingering in it: and this is the way of the heart; we do not ſay point blank, we will never build the Houſe; No, but ſhuffle it off, <hi>It is not yet time,</hi> and we <hi>know not our way,</hi> and the <hi>enemies</hi> are round about to hinder us; and ſo we conclude the caſe before-hand, and keep off the ſtrait that <hi>Paul</hi> was brought to, when he cries out, <hi>Lord what wouldst thou have me to do?</hi> What way ſhould I take? What is thy minde in all? All things go croſs; there is no thriving nor proſpering in out ways, but all ſymptomes appear to ſignifie a conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is upon our way; we are ſcarcely kept alive, have ſcarce a bit of bread to ſtay our hunger: Now what is the meaning of all this? Sure there is a Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Therefore need there is every Soul of you ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider your ways, and enquire, <hi>Lord, is it I?</hi> or, <hi>Is it I?</hi> Do I hinder this work? where am I guilty? For though it chiefly concern the Leaders and chief ones to
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:169498:146"/>
conſider, and take it to heart, yet ſomething belongs to all to look after: <hi>What is my place? Where am I to ſtand? Am I faithful in the work entruſted me?</hi> To be faithful in little things, is the way to be truſted in greater. Surely, ſurely, 'tis time to bethink our ſelves we have no good nor peace in our way: though we live, and are kept together by a mighty hand, yet we live looſe, and ſcattered, and conſume in our ſpirits: Certainly if we could but meet with the very root of all theſe ill humors, and get that cleared, then we might hope for cure; if we were but once brought to leave the <hi>cumber about many things,</hi> and minde <hi>the one thing neceſſary,</hi> then we might proſper. O Lord! that he would ſink it on your hearts! as God ſaith here, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider your ways,</hi> you that are called to; for all are not <hi>materials</hi> for this Houſe, not any dirt and rubbish; but you that the <hi>Prophecy</hi> hath taken in, That <hi>you are living ſtones,</hi> and that witneſs is born, <hi>It is your Fathers good pleaſure to give you a Kingdom,</hi> will not you build him a Houſe? you that he hath beſtowed all this coſt on? you are called upon to begin and ſet upon the work, and lay the <hi>foundation</hi> of this Houſe, that your children may have a pattern to build after, and a foundation to build upon. We pretend to love our children, and Oh how tender are we of them! but alaſs, we do what we can to undo them utterly, if we come not up to this work, to begin a Houſe for the Lord, and leave a way behinde us, for them to walk in.

                     </hi> is ſtoln from them, becauſe there is not a true, and ſingle, and clear coming off from the world, but we ſtick, and linger, and put off the time, and look back to our <hi>old Lovers,</hi> and hanker,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:169498:147"/>
and ſtill <hi>love our ſelves,</hi> and come not forth reſolvedly to build this Houſe: and thus in ſtead of leaving a good example, a bleſſing to our children, we are like to leave them a curſe and a blaſt, if the Lord prevent not: The way is open at preſent, there is no outward perſecution that hinders but we might build this houſe in peace; but we trifle, and dringle, and loyter, and ſay, <hi>It is not yet time.</hi> Good Lord, when ſhall we ſay, <hi>It is time!</hi> but we plead, we have no heart: Have we no heart? and what is the reaſon of that? We have a heart to our eaſe, a heart to our own wills; we have a heart to build ſieled houſes for our ſelves to dwell in, and ſhall we dye thus with this <hi>old heart?</hi> and never ſee a <hi>new heart</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, a heart wholly to follow the <hi>Lord!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But then laſtly, If any thing will invite and move us to ſtir,</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. Conſider THE GREAT PRIVILEDGES THAT ACCRUE TO THEM THAT SHALL SET THEIR HAND TO THIS WORK: And they are theſe four.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is mentioned Verſ. 8. <hi>Go up to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>and bring wood, and build this houſe, and I will take pleaſure in it.</hi> Now to have the Lord accept our ſacrifice, and take pleaſure in our work, what a high favor is it? Were it but truly layd to heart, That the God of the Heavens and Earth, whoſe all creatures are, to command and turn at his Will; That I ſhould do any thing (may the Soul ſay) to pleaſe him, in which he will take delight, who can expreſs this favor? &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another Priviledg is mentioned Verſ. 13. <hi>I am with you, ſaith the Lord:</hi> Will he be with them in it? that they ſhall not go, nor ſtir a ſtep in this work, but he will go along with them? Is not this enough to carry them on? <hi>If thy preſence go not with me</hi> (ſaid <hi>Moſes)
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:169498:147"/>
ſend me not hence:</hi> I, but if that preſence go along, then ſend, do, and command me whither thou wilt: What would not a man do that loves <hi>God</hi> indeed? what would not he ſuffer, and part with, and undergo, to have God always with him? to have his Friend, his Counſellor, Life and Protector, to have him always ſtand by him in all that befals? <hi>If God be for us</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>who can be againſt us?</hi> what can be too hard? Therefore we ſee our Fathers have rejoyced in priſons, in fires, in bonds, becauſe the Lord was with them, and ſo long affliction is no affliction.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third great Mercy is promiſed <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>From this day will I bleſs you:</hi> From that day that the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Lords houſe was layd: Conſider it now (ſaith the Lord) <hi>from this day and upward will I bleſs you:</hi> In all thou takeſt in hand ſhall a ſure bleſſing fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, in thy going out and coming in, when thou walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt abroad and when thou ſitteſt at home, when thou ſleepeſt and when thou wakeſt; from that very day you ſhall be helped to ſet a hand to the work indeed: He will ſurely bleſs you. <hi>We have forſaken all, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter,) what ſhall we have?</hi> Have! you ſhall have enough; you that have endured with me in my <hi>Temptations,</hi> you ſhall ſit on <hi>Thrones;</hi> you ſhall be bleſt in all your way: and what can you deſire more?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The fourth Mercy is mentioned in the laſt verſe, <hi>I will make thee as a ſignet upon my hand</hi> (ſaith God to <hi>Zerubbabel.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>And in that theſe three Priviledges lie couched up.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A Signet hath a neer relation to the hand, it is worn always and carryed upon the finger.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A Signet carries the image and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:169498:148"/>
either of a mans ſelf, or ſome friend; or ſome weighty thing or other is carved in it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A Signet, or Seal, is to witneſs, confirm, and ratifie; to make things ſure and unalterable, that are once ſealed with it. And now, 1. To be thus neer to God, as the ſignet upon his hand, to lie ſo cloſe, ſo nigh him, in his <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>boſom</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> as his <hi>delight,</hi> his <hi>jewel,</hi> his <hi>ornament;</hi> This is wonderful! And then, 2. To bear forth his own <hi>image</hi> and <hi>ſtamp,</hi> to be like him, to own our <hi>Father</hi> by our <hi>faces;</hi> as 'tis ſaid of <hi>Moſes, His face ſhone</hi> when he came from talking with God in the Mount: It will appear to all whoſe we are, to whom we belong, by the image and likeneſs we ſhall hear in us; all our words and carriages ſavoring of God, bearing forth his image, his minde and heart. And then, 3. To be as a <hi>ſeal,</hi> to witneſs and ratifie the deeds of God, to confirm and make all ſure; This is a mighty honor, that man ſhould ever be employed in ſuch a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: <hi>Whoſe ſins ye remit, they are remitted</hi> in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and whoſe ſins ye binde in Earth, they are bound in Heaven: <hi>I will make thee as a God</hi> (ſaid the Lord to <hi>Moſes,</hi>) to act, and order, and counſel, and confirm in my place; <hi>Lo, thus ſhall the man be bleſt that feareth the Lord,</hi> he ſhall be as a <hi>Signet</hi> upon his hand.</p>
                  <p>O then that your Souls were at a ſtrait indeed, that you might cry out, <hi>O who will give me of the waters of Bethlehem to drink!</hi> Who will help, and counſel, and direct? who will ſhew me how to begin to build this Houſe of the Lord? that I may ſhare in all theſe bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and eſcape all the great curſes, and <hi>ſtand in that day;</hi> That the Lord may take pleaſure in me, and be with me, and bleſs me in all my ways, and bear me as a Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net on his hand, ſo nigh himſelf, and make me ſo like himſelf, ſo ſerviceable and highly impowered to act for
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:169498:148"/>
him. O that it were in your hearts to cry this night, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Soul apart, <hi>O that he would count me worthy</hi> to help on this building! That is the next thing, if God will pleaſe to give us a heart to cry together and ſtrive with him, and not let him go until he bleſs us, till we ſhall be counted worthy to begin to build, and made to ſay and feel, <hi>My heart is ready (O God,) my heart is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:</hi> That you may ſay to all Idols, Get you hence: Friends, and relations, and eaſe, and honors, farewel all; <hi>let the dead bury their dead:</hi> you are but <hi>dead enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and I am called, and muſt go, to build <hi>a living Houſe</hi> to the Lord!</p>

                  <p>TWo things I have already mentioned to you out of this Scripture: I. Why it is that God will ſpeak to his people by a Prophet; why not alone by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, without outward means and help of man? No; but <hi>Go thou neer to the Lord our God for us, and ſpeak thou unto us, &amp;c.</hi> and God approves of the thing as good: <hi>They have well ſpoken in all that they have ſaid.</hi> I ſhewed you five Reaſons, why this was ſo. 1. Becauſe it is his <hi>pleaſure,</hi> his <hi>ordinance,</hi> the <hi>way</hi> he hath appointed for that purpoſe, where he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Bleſſing; and if we neglect that way, we can proſper in no other. 2. It is a gentle and familiar way, ſuited to mans capacity and weakneſs: God in himſelf is too dreadful and dazling; but <hi>a Prophet will the Lord raiſe unto you out of your Brethren, him ſhall you hear.</hi> 3. The Wiſdom and Power of God is more manifeſt by uſing ſuch <hi>weak means,</hi> a worm, a nothing; That this <hi>rich treaſure</hi> ſhould be put in <hi>earthen veſſels,</hi> it makes the <hi>glory</hi> wholly to appear Gods. 4. By this he brings his people into an union, an order and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, elſe all would live looſe, alone, and ſcattered to themſelves; but now all are brought under one <hi>Guide,</hi> one <hi>Shepherd,</hi> one <hi>Interpreter</hi> between God and them. 5. By this the particular work of Salvation is made more diſtinctly to appear; <hi>Of Zion it ſhall be ſaid, ſuch and
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:169498:151"/>
ſuch a man was born there:</hi> The particular characters ſhall be ſet down; In ſuch a <hi>place,</hi> at ſuch a <hi>time,</hi> by ſuch a <hi>man,</hi> from ſuch a <hi>word,</hi> the Soul ſhall diſtinctly know all its leadings on. Then ſomething hath been ſpoke of that,</p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>Go thou neer:</hi> This <hi>Prophet is to go neer to God.</hi> They hit on the right nick, God will have it ſo.</p>
                  <p>And that for theſe Reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To teſtifie his <hi>freeneſs</hi> and <hi>open-heartedneſs</hi> to them; <hi>To you it is given</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples) <hi>to underſtand the myſteries of God, but to others in Parables;</hi> They come not ſo nigh to read his heart and boſom. They that travelled with <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus,</hi> they ſaw the light that ſhone about him, but none heard the voyce, That was whiſpered unto <hi>Paul</hi> alone, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> None elſe was taken to be delt with in that manner, in whom the Word entered, and ſearched, and came nigh to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: but they that would indeed know the minde of God, the inward meaning, there is need they ſhould have a heart raiſed to ſearch and enquire of God pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, What is the very thing he intends in all? Many enquire no farther then the Scriptures, the outward let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and the light of their Reaſon joyned together; but alaſs, I cannot finde out the meaning of the heart of God concerning me by all this! Therefore if there be not an <hi>Interpreter, one of a thouſand, that can ſhew to man his righteouſneſs;</hi> if there be not a <hi>days-man</hi> for us, that can come nigh to God, and enquire his minde and thoughts towards us, then are we miſerable: for alaſs, we cannot go neer our ſelves; who of us <hi>can ſtand before ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting burning!</hi> No, (ſaith God to <hi>Moſes) Thou canſt not ſee my face, and live:</hi> No <hi>ſelf,</hi> no <hi>fleſh,</hi> no
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:169498:151"/>
                     <hi>evil thing</hi> can live in the preſence of God, the fire is too hot; <hi>He will have no fellowſhip with the ſtool of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> If you will come neer God, there is need of a heart without all guile and deceit, that <hi>intends</hi> what it <hi>pretends; Will you be my people indeed</hi> (ſaith God?) <hi>Indeed?</hi> Nothing elſe will paſs; He will divide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween words and thoughts, between thoughts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions; if there be but a tittle againſt thee, he'l be ſure to finde it out: <hi>I know thy Works, and Love, and Patience,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt;) I, but yet <hi>I have a few things againſt thee:</hi> He ſpies out the leaſt flaw; and therefore it is dreadful coming neer him without that garment of <hi>Love,</hi> which can cover a multitude of ſins; for elſe alaſs, he may take advantage every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and conſume us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This is another end of coming thus neer God, That the Soul may ſtand reverently, and with deep attendance of minde, as in the Kings preſence: Were you but aware that God was ſo neer you, ſure it would ſtrike a great awe and warineſs upon your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: What, is the Lord in this place, and I knew it not? Is this <hi>no leſs then the gate of Heaven?</hi> Am I in the preſence of the great God, and have to do with him in all my words, and thoughts, &amp; hearings? O what need is there of an awful ſpirit? Holineſs becometh this Houſe for ever. Many go to Church, it may be twenty or thirty years, and never yet were their hearts affected with the leaſt true fear and awe; 'tis becauſe they come not nigh God in their ſervice, but make it a meer cuſtom and May-game: but he will have his people come nigh him, he will have them ſtand in his preſence with awe and reverence, and godly fear; he will have their words and prayers weighed and ſcan'd to a tittle. How careleſly and inconſiderately do many venture on praying? as
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:169498:152"/>
men caſt bones from them to a dog; never think of the thing, never look to ſee what becomes of their prayers: but God will have his ſtand in another kind of poſture; <hi>As the eyes of a maid are unto the hands of her miſtreſs, ſo are our eyes up to thee, O Lord:</hi> He will have them wait, and look, and attend; when ever a word ſhall drop from his mouth, and touch upon them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are to go neer to God for this end, to learn his behavior and carriage; <hi>Be ye holy, as I am ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> (ſaith God:) <hi>Learn of me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt,) <hi>I am meek and lowly: I will go down to Sodom</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>and ſee whether it be altogether ſo as the cry is come up unto me:</hi> Why, did not God know? Doth he need to go and ſee? No; but it is to teach us how to behave our ſelves in ſuch caſes, to teach us to be <hi>ſure</hi> and <hi>wary,</hi> and <hi>juſt</hi> in judgment; before we paſs ſentence againſt any, to know what we do; to learn his tender-hearted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and compaſſion, and forbearance; to learn his manners and ways: and if ever you are brought neer him, it will be for theſe purpoſes.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. The next thing to be conſidered in general, is, AND HEAR THOU ALL THAT THE LORD OUR GOD SHALL SAY UNTO THEE.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hear all,]</hi> Every tittle, let nothing be loſt that he ſpeaks. Now there are three general things which the Lord ſpeaks, and would have all his people know, that ſtand in the ſame condition as <hi>Iſrael</hi> now did. 1. He would have them know where they are, that they are yet in the Wilderneſs, yet not at home, but far from Reſt. 2. What is their way to attain it. 3.

                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p n="1">1. That this is the day, in which he will prove our hearts. Now will he <hi>open the fountains of the great Deep,</hi> the low channells of the earth are now made to appear, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. Now he diſcovers what man is, what a helpleſs wretched thing: Now he opens the ſtrange wickedneſs that lay hid in the heart; the fire makes the ſcum riſe, the <hi>fiery trialls,</hi> the great and <hi>ſore temptations</hi> (as God calls them) theſe ſtir, and fetch up all the poyſon that lay buried before: Now the <hi>Lingrings,</hi> and <hi>drawings back,</hi> the <hi>murmurings,</hi> the <hi>ill will,</hi> the <hi>frettings,</hi> and <hi>madneſs</hi> of the heart ſhews it ſelf: when there muſt be no water given, but what comes out of a rock, a flint, ſuch a ſtrange unthought of way, and impoſſible to reaſon; and that they muſt have no <hi>bread</hi> but what is given them new every morning, that they can turn them no wayes <hi>from their miſeries,</hi> nor to <hi>their mercies:</hi> that they cannot reach out a hand to help themſelves; but though they dye and ſtarve, and periſh, yet there is no remedy, but they muſt lie at the foot of God, and take what he gives, and no more: this is a day that will prove the heart indeed, and what is in it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As it is a day of Triall, ſo God would have us know, <hi>it is not our reſt,</hi> our home, there is a great journy to be gone, <hi>up Elijah why ſitteſt thou here?</hi> Alaſs, you are far from home, you are not come to the <hi>good Land</hi> yet, which brings forth of it ſelf <hi>milk</hi> and <hi>hony!</hi> and this greatly diſpleaſed the Lord, that they ſhould here in this wilderneſs ſit down to eat and drink,

and riſe up to play: Is this a place, Is this a time to ſit down in, and feaſt?

That there is ſurely a <hi>Rest for the people of God:</hi> that they ſhall not alwayes be as a rowling ſtone, not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways vagabonds, and wanderers, following the Prince of the Air, with thoſe reſtleſs toſſing Spirits: this <hi>God</hi> would have his people know, that there is a <hi>Reſt,</hi> there is an expected <hi>end,</hi> a day of <hi>freedom,</hi> when all bonds, and chains ſhall be broken, Sin ſhall not alwayes, reign, the enemy ſhall not afflict and torment for ever. <hi>I would not live alwayes</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) by any means, I am weary of it:</hi> This <hi>God</hi> would you ſhould hear, but now whilſt we are in that <hi>horrible pit,</hi> the pit of <hi>noiſe,</hi> we can hear nothing, but deſtruction upon deſtruction, one ſtorm and wave comes upon the neck of another, there is no reſpite given no time to ſwallow the ſpittle, (as <hi>Job</hi> complains) ſo that the ſoul is, as it were diſtracted, to ſee no way of eſcape, that it is like alwayes to be thus with it: <hi>But is there not an appointed time for man upon earth?</hi> Yes, <hi>God</hi> would have you hear, and be ſurely ſet down in that, that there is an end.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He would have you know, when this end is to be.</p>
                  <p>It is ſaid, when <hi>Chriſt ſhall have put down all rule and all authority, &amp; all power, then to comes the end:</hi> a time is to be when <hi>Chriſt ſhall reign</hi> in the world in his glory, and his Saints reign with him, and all Scepters and Kingdoms ſhall be made to bow and ſtoop under him: but there is a time of his reigning in the particular ſouls of his People, when all that oppoſes and offends ſhall be taken out of the way, no end will come till then: we ſhall find no reſt in our Souls, till the word of Life ſhall come and put down all other rule and government, to bring <hi>every thought</hi> into <hi>ſubjection,</hi> every Luſt and Hunt of heart, all Pride and Envy, and ſelf-love, all thoſe lords that have ruled over us, muſt down, before this
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:169498:154"/>
end ſhall be; and till this be done, there will be nothing but <hi>wars and rumours of wars, Nation againſt Nation, and Kingdome againſt Kingdome, and famine, and peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and earthquakes;</hi> nothing but troubles, and perplexities and trialls, till this end come: now to be kept through all theſe, is the Salvation: <hi>He that endures to the end, the ſame ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. What is this end? What is the Reſt of the People of God: Hear and know that, and that reſt is the ſole <hi>raigning,</hi> and rule of <hi>God</hi> in the ſoul, when Chriſt ſhall deliver up the Kingdom to the Father, and God ſhall be all in all: Now the Heir is under Tutours and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, now up, and now down, under fears and faintings, and Terrors, becauſe the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is not yet come, that Kingdom of Peace and Truth; God is not yet all in all, we are yet ſtragling after our wills and luſtings, and covetings to our ſelves, and ſo can have no peace in all our wayes, till we ſhall be brought under that peaceable Government, to ſubmit to that <hi>one Lord</hi> in every thing; to give the <hi>Crown</hi> out of our <hi>hand</hi> unto him whoſe due it is, that God may be all in all.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>hear all</hi> that the <hi>Lord</hi> ſhall ſay, not by halves, and piecemeals, but hear all, <hi>every word of God is good:</hi> how many of you content your ſelves, when you have but a little <hi>Light</hi> to ſee where you are, how your condition ſtands! but alas, that is miſery, if you hear only your <hi>ſhortneſs,</hi> that you are in a Wilderneſs, if you hear not of a reſt too, of an end, if you periſh and fall ſhort in the mid way, what ſhall then come of all? but oh how impoſſible is it to make any thing ſeiſe upon a flint, to make a word enter upon an iron heart. I wonder ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, the word ſhould ſink no more, being it is told you over, and over again, and yet all paſſes away as an idle tale, but that I know, it is impoſſible to be otherwiſe,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:169498:155"/>
till there be a new heart given, and an ear bored by God to receive inſtruction.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. The next general Thing, is the Peoples Promiſe, AND WE WILL HEAR IT, AND DO IT.</p>
                  <p>And if this be not the thing ſet down in your hearts and minds, if we intend not this, to come <hi>to doing,</hi> to be the thing that is called for, alas, what do we come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for? Why do we hear? What will come of all our way, if we are not truly brought to this mind, <hi>we will hear and do</hi> all that the <hi>Lord</hi> ſhall command? About this hearing, five things may be conſidered.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You are to hear <hi>who</hi> it is that ſpeaks: <hi>My ſheep hear my voice,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>and the voice of a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they will not hear:</hi> there is need diſtinctly to know him that ſpeaks &amp; calls, and not take every word by road that ſeems good and true, as the world do, but to be able ſurely to diſcern and diſtinguiſh between the voyce of <hi>God,</hi> and the voice of <hi>man,</hi> and the voice of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> for the ſame outward words may be taken up by them all, the Devil can ſpeak Scripture to Chriſt; <hi>He ſhall give his Angels charge over thee, leſt thou daſh thy foot againſt a ſtone:</hi> and the Jews, (the great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Chriſt) they can ſpeak as good words as may be, they ſay to the blind man recovered to his ſights <hi>Give Glory to God:</hi> what better and righter word can be ſpoken? But yet, how baſe and wicked was it from them? for in the next word they reject Chriſt; <hi>as for this man, we know he is a ſinner.</hi> Now if we be not made to look into the inwards of words, and ſee what runs in them, what <hi>Spirit</hi> breaths, whether God, or the enemy, or mans own heart, if we know not this, we know nothing: and ſure the word now preached to us is as an idle tale, and we do not ſeriouſly enquire who it is that ſpeaks? whether this Doctrine be <hi>from heaven,</hi>
                     <pb n="289" facs="tcp:169498:155"/>
or <hi>from men,</hi> whether the Lord ſpeaks indeed unto us? I told you, the Lord would have you know where you are at the preſent, that you are in a deſolate Wilderneſs, where a thouſand dangers and miſeries lie in the way, and it is ten thouſand to one, whether you get clear through all, but fall ſhort in ſome pit or other: Now do you believe this indeed? do you think it is the <hi>Lords voyce,</hi> that he ſpeaks his very word to you? Alas! what a miſt do the world live in? How do they go to Church, and hear, and hear, year after year, and it ſcarce e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver comes into any of their minds once to think ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly: <q>what is this I hear? whoſe voyce is it? Doth God ſpeak to me of a certain, or is it onely the <hi>voyce</hi> of <hi>a man?</hi> If it be man onely, then what do I hearing? it is a vain ſervice: but if <hi>God,</hi> then why ſeiſeth it no more?</q> why do they not tremble under it? And this old Taint we retain from them, and thus I fear moſt of our hearings ſlip away without a ſerious enquiry who it is that ſpeaks to us, whoſe voyce calls: for if we were certainly perſwaded, that when a word touches our <hi>hearts,</hi> when it reproves, and finds us <hi>Sinners,</hi> when it pulls and ſtirs to <hi>ariſe,</hi> and be going, did we ſurely know it is <hi>God</hi> that reproves, and touches and ſtirs within us, certainly we durſt not ſo ſtand out and ſleight it, as we do. If it be indeed the <hi>word of God,</hi> it will not be dallied with: It is quick and lively, and will work one way or other, it will either kill or ſave, condemn or ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, draw to <hi>God,</hi> or drive from him; he will not ſpeak in vain; therefore in all hearings, hear this firſt, who is it that ſpeaks?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The next thing is to <hi>hear what he ſpeaks, I will hear what the Lord God will ſay,</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) hear the <hi>particular word</hi> and meſſage that comes to me, for he ſaith to one, <hi>Go,</hi> and he is to go, and to anoth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I now ſome of you that are like a poſt in a wall, it is as impoſſible to make you hear a word of truth, the ear is ſo ſtopp'd, <hi>charm the charmer never ſo wiſely.</hi> Now the word ſpoke to ſuch, is, to know where they are to own thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I would in generall obſerve to you a fourfold time of raigning, which ſucceed and follow one the other. 2. A time of the mans raigning. 2.

                  <p n="1">I. There is a time of <hi>Mans reign,</hi> when the man hath a great liberty and ſwinge to turn himſelf about hither and thither as he pleaſe, and meets with no let nor croſs, nor trouble in his way. When <hi>Peter is young he girds himſelf and walks whither he liſts,</hi> but when he <hi>grows old</hi> the caſe is altered, another girds and leads him whither he would not: but the <hi>man</hi> hath his day of liberty, when the graſs is in its prime, and the flower in its full beauty, the man can turn him to his eaſe and parts, and inlargments, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of truth, and injoyments of creatures, and ſuck ſweet every where. Thus was <hi>Iob</hi> in his day, when his ſteps were <hi>waſhed in Butter,</hi> and the rocke poured out <hi>rivers of oil,</hi> his <hi>beauty</hi> was <hi>freſh</hi> in him, and he ſate as a <hi>king in the army</hi> under the flouriſhings and inlargments of truth, he could walk, and ſpeak, and act, and chooſe, and refuſe, exhort and incourage others, and all takes, and proſpers and finds acceptance, and here he thinks he is ſure, <hi>Then I ſaid, I ſhall dye in my neſt,</hi> &amp;c. And this time of greenneſs in the truth is yet upon ſome of you &amp; affords the man ſweetneſs and liberty; and how long did many of us walk in this poſture?
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:169498:163"/>
coming forth delicately with <hi>Agag,</hi> and ſaying, <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the bitterneſſe of death is paſt.</hi> 
                     <q>So have we ſecretly promiſed our ſelves, I have forſaken the world, and am come off from all the falſe wayes of worſhip, and have left friends and preferments, and am ſet down to the truth, and ſure now the worſt is over, now I am ſafe and in a good way:</q> and here the man ſits down on a <hi>high ſeat</hi> above all creatures, and bonds and ſnares, takes eaſe and content, and reigns with truth, as <hi>Paul</hi> writes to the <hi>Corinthians, Ye are free and reign as Kings;</hi> they thought all was ſure and the liberty of man would laſt alwayes. I, but (ſaith <hi>Paul) I would to God you did reign, viz.</hi> that it were ſuch a reigne as would laſt and hold. Now who ſpake he to? not to the rude world, nor to the ignorant, but ſuch as he had in his heart to live and dye with, ſuch as he had eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to Chriſt, the match was made, but not the thing done; they were not wrought <hi>off from</hi> all things, nor wrought <hi>up to</hi> that one husband, into the minde of Chriſt, though out of a light inſtruction and choice the thing was owned and approved. And here the <hi>man</hi> gets peace, and eaſe and liberty, is free from guilt and torments, and perplexities, the man can goe on either hand, if a mind to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> thither he can turn: if a mind to the <hi>Creatures,</hi> he can turn thither, the door is open, and he can ſuck ſweet from every thing, his wayes are all waſht in butter, ſmooth, ſoft and eaſie. And here (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) my mountain was ſo ſtrong, <hi>I ſaid I ſhall never be moved,</hi> here the <hi>man</hi> ſits as a <hi>King,</hi> this is his day of reigning. But,</p>
                  <p n="2">II. There is another diſpenſation follows, a time of the <hi>Devils reign,</hi> this is a ſad and wofull change. <hi>Another king ariſes which knows not Joſeph,</hi> the <hi>man,</hi> when he was King, he knew God and owned truth,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:169498:163"/>
and joyned it with him in his Kingdom, (though yet in the throne <hi>Pharaoh</hi> will ſit above) [the man was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt in all:] But now <hi>another king</hi> riſes, that will not know <hi>Joſeph;</hi> and he deals cruelly with <hi>Iſrael:</hi> then the hard Task-maſters and cruel burdens come: he will know nothing but his own will, and luſt and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty: And <hi>Wo to the inhabitants of the world,</hi> when <hi>the devil comes down to reign amongſt them;</hi> when <hi>Jeroboam</hi> reigns, that makes <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſin. And how often have our fathers been at ſore pinches, and cried out in bitterneſs of ſoul, when this time of the devils reign was upon them! It is a woful kingdom indeed, a cruel reign. And theſe ſeven Woes lie up in it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. One Wo is, that he is a <hi>ſtrong man.</hi> How have our fathers owned his might, and cried out under it! <hi>Thou haſt delivered me</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) from my STRONG enemy: for he was too ſtrong for me.</hi> And again: <hi>My enemies live, and they are MIGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY.</hi> And <hi>Hezekiah</hi> cries out, <hi>Lord, I am oppreſt; undertake for me.</hi> And again: <hi>We have no might againſt this</hi> GREAT HOST. Alas, when the man compares but himſelf to him, what a Nothing is he to this great <hi>Goliah!</hi> but as a fly, a worm, a gnat; a ſtripling, and he a man of war from his youth. And here the heart ſinks and dies at the very thoughts of dealing with him. Was he but an ordinary enemy, that might be matched any ways, and the thing but feaſible to fight with him; then Man would have ſome hope: but alas, he carries all before him. <hi>Shall not one be caſt down at the very ſight of him?</hi> (as 'tis ſaid of the Leviathan, who was a type of the devil.) <hi>Iron is counted as rotten wood to him: he laughs at the ſhaking of a ſpear.</hi> Who is able to deal with this monſtrous <hi>Leviathan?</hi> If ever you but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to reaſon and tamper the matter with him, you are
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:169498:164"/>
certainly foiled and worſted; he will ſurely get beyond you; 'tis in vain to contend with him: But let him vaunt, and boaſt, and rail on; the <hi>Kings command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is, not to anſwer a word: that's the way Truth points us to, to be ſtill, and lie under, and ſay with Chriſt, <hi>This is your hour, and the power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> Until we can go out againſt him as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>in the Name of the Lord,</hi> let us never ſtir: though he come and vaunt himſelf, and reproach <hi>Iſrael</hi> fourty days, yet there is no other way, but, with <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> to ſpread the Letter before the Lord, and cry under the miſery.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He is not onely ſtrong, but a <hi>thorowout malign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant enemy,</hi> maliciouſly ſet and bent to deſtroy all truth; <hi>exalts himſelf above all that is called God;</hi> root and branch; he ſtrikes at all: he deals as <hi>Herod,</hi> who killed all the children from two yeers old and upward, that he might be ſure to meet with the <hi>childe Jeſus,</hi> and not let him eſcape. So this malicious enemy kills every budding and ſpringing of God in the ſoul; he kills all the <hi>light,</hi> kills the <hi>ſingle love,</hi> kills all the <hi>good deſires,</hi> that not ſo much as a right word, or deſire, or groan, may live: and in all this, his aim is, utterly to deſtroy the Truth, the <hi>principle of God</hi> ſown in the ſoul. Alas, he cares not elſe: if he can but kill the little ſpark of the Spirit of life, he cares not what elſe paſſes by and lives. Let us hear, and meet together, and eat, and trade, and take eaſe and content; this is not the thing he is ſet againſt ſo, but to <hi>ſmite the king of Iſrael onely,</hi> that is his plot; that was the wicked counſel of <hi>Ahithophel,</hi> to kill <hi>David</hi> onely, and bring all the people back to <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalom:</hi> Neither ſmall nor great doth he ſtrike at, but the <hi>King</hi> onely: he cares not what lives, ſo the Lord Chriſt the Truth, the Seed of life, the Heart and
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:169498:164"/>
Minde of God] may die in us. Such a height of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs is in him, that nothing elſe will content him, but the death of all that would be a Lord over him: a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouler, a King, this, <hi>Herod</hi> cannot bear. That which <hi>ſits in the kings gate, and will not bow to him,</hi> [that reſolved <hi>Truth</hi> that will not fall down and worſhip the <hi>Idol</hi>] nothing will content <hi>Haman</hi> but the death of this: though he get Decrees againſt all the <hi>Jews,</hi> though invited to the <hi>Queens</hi> banquet, and ſit next the <hi>King,</hi> yet nothing will content him, whilſt <hi>this Mordecai lives,</hi> [that <hi>Seed of God,</hi> that <hi>root of the matter,</hi> that, which will not ſtoop and buckle to him, that he aims at] and his fingers itch to cut off this <hi>name of Iſrael</hi> for ever. And Oh, what a Wo is this, to be under ſuch a cruel malicious enemy! that would not give a moments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite, not ſo much as a little breathing-time for the Truth; not a little hope, not a little deſire, not the leaſt ſtirring of an inclination, but he's upon it preſently; if it were poſſible, to ſtop every chink, that the <hi>ſmoaking flax</hi> might not have the leaſt vent, but be utterly extinct and <hi>quenched.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third great Wo lies in this, that he hath <hi>a time and power given him of God,</hi> to afflict and try: God allows it, and gives him leave to ſtrike <hi>Job. This is YO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R HO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R</hi> (ſaith Chriſt:) an hour was given them. And God ſaith, <hi>I will cauſe them to paſs under the rod.</hi> And 'tis ſaid in the <hi>Pſalms, He T<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RNED the hearts of their enemies to hate them.</hi> He gives him his time and commiſſion to rend and tear, waſte, ſpoil, and impriſon; and none can call him to account for it; his <hi>Commiſſion</hi> will bear him out. Alas, what a day is this! In the time when the <hi>Man</hi> reigned, he promiſed himſelf fair, he ſhould ſoon be delivered, and
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:169498:165"/>
get thorow the Battel, and ſee an end of ſorrow: I, but he little thought of this day, as <hi>Job</hi> cries out, <hi>He hath given me over into the hand of the ungodly;</hi> when the <hi>devil</hi> has power given to try and afflict, and torment; to let in what beaſts he will, to deſtroy the vineyard. O wo indeed, when a <hi>Leopard</hi> is ſet to <hi>watch over the city!</hi> when the Devil is ſuffered to keep watch and guard, that nothing can ſtir nor paſs in or out without his leave. Power is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him; he hath a time to lead into captivity <hi>at his will.</hi> But the day will come, when <hi>he that led into captivity, ſhall be led into captivity</hi> himſelf: He that ſpoiled and waſted, and cried, <hi>Down with it down with it, to the very ground.</hi> A turn will come; and then, <hi>Bleſſed ſhall he be that ſerveth thee as thou haſt ſerved us.</hi> But Oh what <hi>havock</hi> doth this murtherer make when it is <hi>his day!</hi> How doth he make the earth utterly waſte and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty, and not a ſtirring of Truth may live! If you minde it, we cannot ſometimes ſpeak a <hi>word,</hi> nor breathe a <hi>groan</hi> towards God, but he flaps on the mouth preſently; ſo cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el is he, when the power is put into his hand. But <hi>now</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) now</hi> I am their ſong; they mock at me; the raſcal and vile rout, <hi>whoſe fathers I would have diſdai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to have ſet with the dogs of my flock:</hi> [every baſe, lowe, unworthy, trifling luſt, can now lord it over the ſoul, and make their ſong on it.] Oh this is a woful day indeed! when the <hi>enemy</hi> has power to <hi>ſerve himſelf</hi> of the ſoul, without any controuler; when he can carry <hi>captive at his will:</hi> this Chriſt cries out againſt; <hi>If it be poſſible, let THIS C<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>P paſs.</hi> And here <hi>David</hi> cries out, Oh <hi>let not the pit ſhut her mouth upon me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Another Wo lies in this: he <hi>keeps the houe;</hi> he is in poſſeſſion: <hi>'The ſpirit that rules in the</hi> HEARTS <hi>of the children of diſobedience.</hi> There is a rotten and tainted ſore within, that is ſeated in the ſoul, and
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:169498:165"/>
ſends forth ſuch an unſavoury ſtink, if it were poſſible, to choak all that is good. The Devil hath got the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-place <hi>in the heart,</hi> is in poſſeſſion; it is his houſe: and therefore whence hear you of all your enemies? whence come your troubles, and perplexities, and wars, and fightings? Come they not <hi>from your luſts?</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>James.</hi>) Is not all the miſchief from within? <hi>Out of the heart come adulteries, and murders, and thefts, an evil eye,</hi> &amp;c. all comes out of the heart. Whence come all the peſters and torments? out of the air, or from another? (as we often put it off) No, the taint is within: Look not without thee for the enemy, nor for the devil; no, but within; <hi>IN THE HEART,</hi> there's the ſeat, that's his palace. A time indeed is to be, of his caſting out; but at preſent he keeps the houſe, and therefore neither good can come in, nor good come out, not a breathing of Truth ſtir, but he preſently cries, <hi>Get you to your tasks, to your tasks;</hi> that's the word that ſtops all. He would not let a groan live: and this brings the ſoul into great bitterneſs, that neither good can come <hi>into it,</hi> nor a groan go out <hi>from it,</hi> but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the Devil flaps Chriſt on the mouth; [ſome baſe taint or guilt comes in, and ſtops the riſe and liberty of Truth.] Alas, to have the Devil dwell ſo neer a man, in his boſom! this is a miſery indeed: Here the ſoul cries out, <hi>Wo is me, that I am conſtrained to dwell with them that hate peace.</hi> This is the preſent day and time with ſome of you: your enemies ſit chief, and <hi>Zion</hi> is in the duſt. I beſeech you, let the Word ſink into your hearts: (for it will have a time to ſink upon you all.) Conſider where you are, under what rule and government. If under the <hi>Mans reign</hi> ſtill, then no marvel indeed you can live looſe and free, and gird your ſelves, and go whither you will: But a time will
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:169498:166"/>
ſurely come, when you ſhall know and feel this <hi>reign of the enemy:</hi> For till this Day be over, you can never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed come under the <hi>reign of Chriſt:</hi> the Day of Chriſt will not be, till <hi>there be a falling away firſt,</hi> (from the Mans reigning) <hi>and that man of ſin be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, the ſon of perdition,</hi> who oppoſeth and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alteth himſelf above all that is called God:</hi> (this is the time of the devils reign.) And until this wicked one be revealed, <hi>whom the Lord</hi> Chriſt <hi>ſhall conſume with the ſpirit of his mouth,</hi> and deſtroy <hi>with the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his coming;</hi> till this, you will never ſee that <hi>day of Chriſt,</hi> nor come under his time of reigning.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. A fifth great Wo is this: He hath goods in us; <hi>his goods are in peace:]</hi> the Prince of this world comes, and findes of his own in us, (though he did not in Chriſt.) And that he hath goods in us, appears by that unſavoury ſmoak that always is coming up out of the bottomleſs pit: <hi>their throat is an open ſepulchre,</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) a continual ill ſavour and ſtink comes forth. As the Church is deſcribed to be full of ſweets, her garments ſmelling of <hi>myrrhe, aloes, and caſſia,</hi> and all ſweet perfumes: ſo in this condition, the ſoul is clothed with nothing but ſtinking rags, and polluted gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The ſoul that is indeed awake and ſenſible, knows not how to endure its own ſtinking ſmell; it is almoſt choaked and overcome with an ill ſavour, which comes from that abundance of rottenneſs, thoſe <hi>goods</hi> of the Devil, and wares of Hell, that lie up in the heart; ſo that the poor man knows not how to ſpeak a word ſometimes, nor think a thought, but an evil taint gets in firſt or laſt, that ſpoileth all; all the <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> are ſo <hi>poiſoned by the devil.</hi> Here <hi>David</hi> cries out, <hi>My wounds ſtink, and are corrupt.</hi> In mars heart is that ſoul <hi>ſepulchre</hi> of dead mens bones, full
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:169498:166"/>
of loathſome rottenneſs. (Do you know this? have you felt and ſeen it in your ſelves?) There is that cage of unclean birds; there is the <hi>Bittern,</hi> the <hi>Screech-owl,</hi> the <hi>Satyr:</hi> there all the beaſts of the Foreſt creep forth: there is the <hi>Lions den,</hi> and all the bones he hath gnawn and ſcattered: <hi>Our bones are ſcattered at the pits brink</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt.) All is corrupt, and become abominable; there are the <hi>goods</hi> of <hi>hell</hi> packt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: there he lays up envie, and wrath, and ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and deceit, and lyes. Now who will believe this report! Who thinks his ſoul and heart to be the devils ſhop, the ware-houſe of hell! But they that feel it, feel it; and they that know, know; and the day will ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come to finde out every man. How fair ſoever we may ſpeak, and mince the matter, and wipe our mouthes; yet the fruit will diſcover the root; <hi>Samuel,</hi> will ask, <hi>What mean the bleatings?</hi> Though we would hide and cover the Devil never ſo cloſe, and paint and garniſh him over with never ſo many <hi>fair pretences,</hi> yet he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo whited, do what we can, but his black <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to them that have eyes, and can diſcern. <hi>Paul</hi> was brought to own and diſcover theſe <hi>goods</hi> of the devil: he cries out. <hi>In me dwells no manner of good thing;</hi> all is corrupt. And God ſaith of <hi>Jeruſalem, As a fountain caſts out its water, ſo Jeruſalem caſts forth her ſin.</hi> Now a fountain caſts out water <hi>naturally;</hi> it flows without pumping, and <hi>continually,</hi> it never ſlacks night nor day: and 3ly, a fountain caſts out <hi>abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> no meaſure of it: and 4ly, <hi>irreſiſtibly;</hi> who can ſtop it? So the heart caſts out ſin; ſuch a ſtock and endleſs ſtore of the <hi>devils goods,</hi> are laid up in the heart. Do you believe this?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Another great Wo is this: He is not onely a ſtrong enemy, and moſt maliciouſly bent, and power
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:169498:167"/>
put in his hand, and in poſſeſſion, and hath ſtuffed the houſe with his goods; but 6ly, he is <hi>armed</hi> too; he hath armour to defend and maintain himſelf, and keep off all aſſaults that are made againſt him.</p>
                  <p>Now his Armour may be expreſſed under theſe three Notions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He hath a <hi>coat of male</hi> upon him, which covers him quite over, that no word of Truth can come to touch and enter into him, and finde him guilty, though you try again and again, and ſhoot and ſhoot bullet after bullet, yet nothing ſhall enter; his ſcales are ſo cloſe to one another, that not the leaſt air can come between, until the Lord ſhall direct an arrow <hi>thorow the joynts of his armour,</hi> and come to the heart: but it's out of the reach of any creature to do it: his coat of male keeps off all: And though you may cruſh his coat a little ſometimes, and hurt him a little; yet he preſently gets up again, and ſhakes himſelf, and he is well; the wound is healed for it never came to his heart: his <hi>coat of male</hi> hath a thouſand twiſtings and windings, to keep off all <hi>guilt</hi> from coming ſo nigh him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He is armed with a <hi>helmet of braſs</hi> upon his head: his <hi>wiſdom</hi> fences him, that he is mighty able to plead the cauſe, and reaſon and diſpute for himſelf: you ſhall never out-ſpeak nor out-reaſon him, he has ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſubtil windings and ways to put off the guilt: <hi>The fool is wiſer in his own eyes, then a man that can give a reaſon.</hi> He hath a brazen brow, that be the caſe never ſo clear, yet he will not bluſh, nor ever yeeld he is <hi>guilty;</hi> but ſome way, or trick, or ſhift is ever at hand to put it off, and ſave himſelf from being a <hi>ſinner:</hi> ſome plaiſter or other he will finde, to heal the wound, and keep the guilt from ſinking to his heart: though the caſe be never ſo plain againſt him,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:169498:167"/>
and though ſeven [a compleat number] witneſs and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him; yet his helmet of braſs keeps off all: he will not be guilty.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He is armed with a great <hi>ſpear</hi> in his left hand <hi>like a weavers beam;</hi> and with this he dare challenge all: Come neer him who can? By this <hi>ſpear</hi> he'll ſeem to be for Truth, and fight the Lords battels, with <hi>Saul,</hi> and ſlay the <hi>Philiſtims:</hi> And who dare charge him now? He is on our ſide; he cries, <hi>A friend, a friend:</hi> He hath the Watch-word and the Colours: he'll come and <hi>build the wall with you;</hi> and who ſhall ſet upon him here: He'll be zealous and forward in the Truth: he'll plead, and anſwer, and prove, and condemn others for being thus and thus, (as the Phariſees did Chriſt.) And this ſpear reaches out ſo far, that there is no way to come nigh to reach, or once queſtion him. <hi>Will you ſpeak wickedly for God?</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job</hi> to his friends.) There is a wicked ſpeaking for Truth, many times; a preaching of Chriſt out of envie, to ſnare another, or finde another guilty, and keep up our ſelves; ſome baſe ſelfiſh end or other lies in it, that ſpoils all. Therefore God ſays, He will be <hi>Judge himſelf:</hi> he will judge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ends and ends, between thoughts and intentions. The Word of the Lord is quick &amp; powerful, that pierceth between marrow and joynts; that can get between, and meet with this enemy, when the time is come. But the work is wonderful: He is ſo ſorely armed all over, 1. with a coat of male; 2. with an helmet of braſs; 3. this long ſpear like a Weavers beam; that, alas, what man ſhall come near to deal with him!</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The laſt great Wo is, that this enemy is <hi>deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately ventrous,</hi> dares venture upon any ſtrange de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes: He'll ſet on Chriſt, and hurry him about to a <hi>high mountain,</hi> to a <hi>pinacle of the Temple,</hi> into the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:169498:168"/>
                     <hi>wilderneſs.</hi> This <hi>Leviathan</hi> is made without fear: being thus armed and fenced, he cares for nothing. Whilſt his armour is ſo cloſe about him, he can venture on the mouth of a Canon, and is ſafe enough. He can vent out all his malice, and poiſon, and rage, and do all his miſchiefs, and none ſhall touch nor controul him, nor come nigh to ſearch his heart. He'll be a friend to God, and Truth, and his People, come not nigh to judge him. And this is the <hi>armour</hi> of the <hi>whole world:</hi> they are thus cheated by the devil, and think all is well and right with them; and under this covert he can work all his pranks and bring about all his miſchiefs and murtherous plots againſt the Truth. And this is a great miſery, the deſperate ventrous ſpirit of this enemy, that ruſhes on all miſchief without fear and dread.</p>
                  <p>Now minde: whilſt this ſtrong man armed keeps his Palace, his goods are in peace; all is at reſt and quiet; there's no trouble nor perplexity, no fears; <hi>the whole earth is at quiet:</hi> and, if it were poſſible, he would never be diſturbed, nor pitch battel with Chriſt, but keep his goods in peace. I, but a time comes when a ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then he comes upon him; and then the war begins, and the battel ſtirs, and the claſhings appear: but this is the great happineſs, that there is one that is <hi>ſtronger then this ſtrong man,</hi> that can deal with him; one that hath all the keys of hell, and can open and unlock all the doors; one that can take away all his armour in which he truſted, and utterly overcome and rout him. <hi>Then</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) the poor hath hope, and all iniquity ſtops her mouth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the way by which Chriſt accompliſheth this, is twofold.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He doth it, as I told you, by taking away all his armour in which he truſted. He truſted in his armour,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:169498:168"/>
that that ſhould ſave him, and keep off all blowes: He truſted no arrow ſhould ever pierce that, and come into his heart, and finde him guilty. He truſted in his <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> that he could reaſon and plead the caſe, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Way to be right and juſt. He truſted, his ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>good words</hi> for God, and pretending for Truth, and his <hi>love, zeal,</hi> and <hi>forwardneſs,</hi> ſhould never have been queſtioned and ranſacked. I, but Chriſt, when he comes, he takes away his armour; all that in which he truſted and hoped, and ſaid, Now I am ſafe; <hi>I ſhall ſit as a Queen for ever, I ſhall never ſee ſorrow.</hi> I, but all his armour and fence is taken from him; and this is a downfal indeed, when he is thus found out, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can hide nor cover him any longer; his coat of Male is taken from him, and then Truth can eaſily enter; then nothing appears, but the mans nakedneſs, and guilt, and ſhame: then the man cries out, with <hi>Paul, I am the chief of ſinners:</hi> then the Word takes place, and enters; and every arrow ſticks: <hi>Thine arrows ſtick faſt in me</hi> (ſaith <hi>David.</hi>) Then the <hi>man</hi> falls under, as a <hi>poor, naked, helpleſs, hopeleſs</hi> thing: then he is counſelled by Chriſt to buy eye-ſalve of him, and gold tried in the fire, and fine linen; for he is found wholly naked, and blinde, and miſerable. We had thought Chriſt had ruled in us, and we had been for God and the Truth: we had thought our zeal, and forwardneſs, and ſpeaking for God, ſhould have paſſed currant; but take away <hi>this armour</hi> of the devil, and then we are found out to be a wretched deceitful people; a lye and deceit appears to be running in all, and that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>ſingle</hi> for God and Truth, without baſe ſelfiſh ends of our own. And this is the firſt work Chriſt is to do in your ſouls, <hi>to ſpoil this ſtrong man of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour;</hi> elſe no Word of truth can ever come nigh and ſeize.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="318" facs="tcp:169498:169"/>2. After Chriſt hath taken away his armour, he then ſeizes on his goods, and <hi>DIVIDES THE SPOYL:</hi> the <hi>ſpoyl!</hi> Why, what uſe can Chriſt make of his ſpoyl? what can he do with all the devils goods? You may ſee the thing illuſtrated, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15. where God ſpeaks thus: Let that which is <hi>for death, go to death; that which is for the ſword, to the ſword; that which is for the famine, to the famine; and that which is for captivity, to captivity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That which is <hi>for death, to death:</hi> ſome of theſe <hi>goods</hi> are preſently to go to <hi>death,</hi> to be utterly deſtroyed: <hi>The enemies which you have ſeen to day,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes) you ſhall never ſee them more.</hi> The malignant diſpoſition, that was ſo wickedly bent againſt all proſpering of Truth; that evil eye, that which lay in the way, that one ſtep Godward could not be taken; that muſt be utterly deſtroyed, and cut off for ever; that abomination muſt live no more; that ill favour, that gave a taint and poiſon to all our ways, and thoughts, and words, that man to Death: Chriſt will ſay to that unclean ſpirit, <hi>Come out of the man, and enter into him again no more.</hi> That <hi>enmity</hi> of ſpirit, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and ill will to all good; the end of that is, to be deſtroyed for ever. That <hi>Cain-like love,</hi> that hates its brother, and would not ſuffer the leaſt breathing, nor proſpering, nor looking up of the Truth: for, according to that evil diſpoſition in you, if you minde it, the heart riſes againſt all good, where-ever it appear; though in a childe, in a brother, in a husband or wife, yet the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity works, and hates to ſee your offering accepted, and mine laid by as nothing. But before Chriſt can ever come to reign, this muſt certainly die, and a whole turn of ſoul be wrought, and we made naturally to love and chuſe the proſperity of the Truth.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="319" facs="tcp:169498:169"/>2. Something muſt go to the ſword: <hi>That which is for the ſword, to the ſword.</hi> The Word of God, that <hi>ſword of the Spirit,</hi> that ſhall ſtill go on (after that great enmity is ſlain) to ſearch, and judge, and quicken, and ſtir up the man, and cut off what hinders that the ſoul may grow up into the minde of God; and as it hath <hi>born the image of the earthly,</hi> ſo to <hi>bear the image of the heavenly:</hi> as we have given our mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſervants to ſin, ſo to give them up to be ſervants of righteouſneſs; to be as free, and voluntary, and earneſt in the ſervice of the Lord, as ever we have been to ſerve our ſelves: to ſpend and be ſpent for the truth, this the <hi>ſword</hi> muſt do; cut out a way thorow all rubbiſh, for this minde to ariſe: It muſt cut away all that ſloth and careleſneſs, that ſluggiſh and carnal minde, that ſits ſtill at home, and would not <hi>come out to help the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the mighty.</hi> When Chriſt ſhall come to deal with us indeed, and uſe his ſword; this muſt all be cut away, and the ſoul pruned.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Something muſt go to the <hi>famine.</hi> That ill <hi>taint,</hi> and <hi>ſetled indiſpoſition,</hi> that has been gathered and contracted by long cuſtom in evil; that hankering and lingering after the wickeds dainties; all this muſt to the famine, and be worn out by degrees, and pined by little and little, till it come to die. Where-ever the heart is taken, and hangs on the creatures, on eating, or wearing, or trading, (or whatever enjoyments) by degrees and degrees a ſecret moth ſhall eat and conſume all: a waſting and conſuming famine muſt cure this evil diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Something muſt go to <hi>Captivity,</hi> and that is the laſt enemy to be deſtroyed: the <hi>Devil</hi> he will yet keep ſome hold and footing, and not be utterly routed, ſo long as there is any <hi>duſt to be the ſerpents food;</hi> ſo
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:169498:170"/>
long as the man hath any life beſide the life of God. I, but now Chriſt ſhall deſigne him to captivity; he ſhall be under; a <hi>hewer of wood, and drawer of water;</hi> a <hi>ſervant</hi> to Chriſt: he ſhall <hi>lord</hi> it no more. He ſhall be bound for a thouſand yeers; and that will be the ſouls greateſt happineſs, to keep him but in his priſon, that he may not break forth, do his miſchievous pranks, but lie in his dungeon, and be an underling to Truth, though he ſtill live; for ſome <hi>Canaanites</hi> will ever live in the land, to be the ſouls trial, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus I have opened to you this Day, the great block that lieth in our way, the bonds and ſhackles that hold us ſo faſt. It is <hi>Satans day,</hi> 'tis his hour, and the power of darkneſs: the <hi>mans Day of reigning</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining and laid aſide in moſt, if not all of you: the man is not ſuffered ſo to bear ſway, and go at liberty, and ſoar aloft in his minde, but there are ſecret checkings, and mindings of a ſhortneſs; and the black feet appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, make the feathers fall. And in ſome of you it is an empty and deſolate Day; you are left without much ſtirring, either from God, or from the enemy: <hi>The land is void of both her kings.</hi> But the greateſt and ſoreſt Day which lies ſore upon ſome of us, is, <hi>The reign of the enemy;</hi> and then <hi>wo to the inhabitants of the world.</hi> Wo to that Land indeed, where the Wicked are in Authority! I opened to you the ſeveral Woes in it.</p>
                  <p>And now to make ſome Uſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Examine, How is it with you? Every ſoul look home: do you feel this <hi>ſtrong enemy?</hi> Do you feel how utterly malignant he is, and contrary to all good? Do you finde it is his hour to be let looſe, to rend, and rear, and perplex, and torment? Do you feel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the <hi>pains of hell,</hi> and do the <hi>ſorrows of death</hi> take
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:169498:170"/>
faſt hold, as <hi>David</hi> cries out they did upon him? If you finde it not ſo now, nor have ever found it; yet certainly a time will come when the enemy will ſhew himſelf, when the wicked one will get up into the throne, and <hi>exalt himſelf above all that is called God:</hi> a time will come of being hurried, and torn, and perplexed, under his wicked and tyrannous reign, when ye ſhall be made ſenſible where you are once: for whilſt you ſtand ſenſleſs, as images and poſts, nothing ſeizes on you, and you never think to ſee ſuch a Day: but whether you feel, or believe to ſee it, yea or not, yet the Day will ſurely come, and <hi>try all that dwell upon the whole earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. You that finde and feel this Day, it may inform you what a vain thing it is for man to ſtir or move hand or foot to reſcue himſelf, or oppoſe this adverſary. Alas, what is man to lift up a hand againſt him! one that is ſo <hi>ſtrong,</hi> and ſo <hi>malignantly</hi> bent to deſtroy; one that hath a <hi>commiſſion</hi> and <hi>power</hi> given; one that is in full <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> of the houſe, and furniſhed with all ſtore of <hi>armour</hi> and <hi>goods</hi> in us. Alas, it is in vain to ſtir againſt him! Man is too weak: 'tis all one as if a poor lone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome woman ſhould have twenty or an hundred plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers in her houſe, ranſacking and breaking up here and there; alas, 'tis in vain for her to ſtand againſt them; they may do what they will, unleſs ſome other help come and reſcue her: ſo vain and impoſſible is it for any of you to winde out of the hands of this enemy, and ſave your ſelves, if another Saviour, <hi>one mightier then he,</hi> deliver you not.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Therefore, in the next place, this might perſwade you to lie down and ſubmit to your bonds, till deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance come. <hi>Anſwer him not a word,</hi> (that is the Kings command, the charge of Truth) but bear all his threats,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:169498:171"/>
and vauntings, and upbraidings. Let all run over, as God ſaith of <hi>Zion: And thou layedſt thy body to the earth, for them to paſs over.</hi> Lie in the condition, how miſerable ſoever it be, till a ſtronger then thou or he ſhall come to deal with him. This is the peaceableſt and moſt ſutable way for our preſent conditions.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Yet this muſt give ſome hint of hope and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, and cauſe the ſoul to put in and wait for a <hi>lot</hi> in this matter, ſince there is for certain ſuch a thing as deliverance to be for ſome: there is <hi>a reſt for the people of God: Our God will come</hi> (ſay they) <hi>and will not tarry.</hi> A ſtronger then he is ſpoke of, that is able to deal with him, and twiſt him about at his pleaſure: and this might give a little encouragement to hope. But as for our parts, we can do nothing in it; we cannot ſtand againſt the enemy, nor can we haſten the riſing of Chriſt to deal with him; <hi>Who ſhall ſay unto God, What doſt thou?</hi> Who ſhall ſtir him up before his time? May he not do what he will? Is he not Lord of all? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no way is for us, but to lie under and endure, and let all the waves go over our backs, till he ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a calm: and he uſes to come in an unexpected time, when all hope of life is gone; when but meal and oyl enough is left to make one cake, and then the widow concludes to die; then comes the word, <hi>The barrel of meal and the cruſe of oyl ſhall not fail,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore Oh that it was in your hearts to cry with one conſent for this Saviour to ariſe; this <hi>Deliverer, that might turn ungodlineſs from Jacob:</hi> All difficulties and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilities are nothing to him: that which is impoſſible with Man, with God is eaſie and poſſible. And this might raiſe up a little ſpringing of hope againſt all rubs and bars that lie in our way. When he comes, he is able to deal with this mighty enemy. He comes provided;
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:169498:171"/>
                     <hi>His works before him, and his rewards with him:</hi> He will divide the ſpoyl, and take away his armor, and ſend that which is for death, to death; that which is for the ſword, to the ſword; that which is for famine, to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; and that which is for captivity to captivity: He keeps ſure records of all, and will ſurely viſit in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time. O therefore that we had a heart raiſed and ſtirred, to cry with one conſent for this Coming of his, and to give no reſt night nor day, but cry, <hi>O come Lord Jeſus, come quickly,</hi> till we have an anſwer, and be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered!</p>

dark, yet it was a great mercy, to have that ſure word of Propheſie, to have entercourſe there: but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las the Lepers, they muſt ſit without the City, where they can hear no word from God, nor have any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of good; there is none to turn aſide to ask how they do, for it is all one in the myſtery, to be out of the houſe, to be out of the ordinance, out of the ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, out of hearing, as not to have the bleſſing that runs in theſe: <hi>In hearing ye ſhall hear, and not underſtand, and ſeeing ye ſhall ſee, and not perceive:</hi> What a miſery is this? and are not we thus an outcaſt? outed from the favourable preſence of the Almighty, outed from the love and hearts of one another? the Court of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hath excluded us, and our own Land caſts us out; we preſently become a burthen to our ſelves and each other, and live only among harlots, and thieves, and murtherers, the ſtrange luſtings, and iniquities of our own hearts: who of you can ſay that word with ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and courage, <hi>Our feet ſhall ſtand in thy gates O Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem?</hi> Who of us is joyned to ano her?

                  <p n="2">2. Another miſery of theſe Lepers is, that <hi>they are all unclean,</hi> and <hi>overſpread with Leproſie;</hi> not only ſhut out of the City, but they muſt come near none, to have any relief: They were to carry a cloth before their mouths, leſt their breath ſhould touch upon any, and ſo infect them, ſo loathſome and noyſome was the diſeaſe upon them: and how truly is this our preſent conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? How do we ſpoil and infect one another with our very words? we cannot ſpeak the leaſt word, but a <hi>Selfiſh taint</hi> runs in it, and is ready to infect whoever

                  <p n="3">3. Yet farther, <hi>They were now under a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Famine:</hi> you may ſee at what a ſtrange price an Aſſes head was ſold, and Doves dung, and how they eat their own children, a woman cryes to the King, <hi>Help O King, this woman and I made a bargain to eat my Son to day, and her Son to morrow; and we boyled my Son, &amp; eat him, and now ſhe hath hid her Son,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.28, 29. a miſerable Famine ſurely! and when <hi>Elijah</hi> prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied of plenty that ſhould be to morrow, one of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, on whom the King leaned, looks upon it as ſuch an impoſſible caſe, that he ſays, <hi>If God ſhould make windows in heaven, can this thing be?</hi> All ſhews the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine was very ſore in the Land, and this was l ke to undo them were there no other miſeries at all upon them. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine is the moſt miſerable, languiſhing, uncomfortable

death that can be: <hi>They that dye by the Sword</hi> (ſaith <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy) are better then they that dye by the Famine:</hi> O what a ſtrange force is there in hunger! How will it turn all upſide down? This at laſt buckles the <hi>Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall</hi> to the Duſt, when nothing could touch him; and how truly is this Famine ſeiſed upon us? <hi>Not a Famine of bread, but of the word of the Lord.</hi> How doth the countenance fall, and wax pale becauſe of the Famine upon our ſpirits! there is no bread to be found to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then mans heart, no oyl to anoint his face, to make a chearfull countenance: I could ask all of you, How long it is ſince you met with a <hi>word of power and vertue</hi> that ſtrengthened and gave life to your ſouls, and ſet you upon your legs to walk on in your journy chearfully and reſolvedly? Sure when you awake you will be ſenſible how <hi>lean</hi> and <hi>poor</hi> you are; you have had ſo much hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to provided and brought to you, as hath juſt kept life and Soul together, that you are not quite famiſhed: and ſo had theſe Lepers, they were alive yet through all, I, but what ſtrange ſhifts were they put to by the Famine? made to eat <hi>Doves Dung,</hi> and <hi>boyl their own children,</hi> ſtrange unnaturall wayes to keep a Life by! and do not we uſe as hard ſhifts? Are not you made often to eat your own children, to eat that which is born of your own fleſh, comes out of your own Bowels? your own wiſdom and reaſon, and counſell, as <hi>David</hi> cries out, <hi>How long ſhall I take counſell in my own heart?</hi> &amp;c. We have no other food to live on now, and that we turn to, rather then we will ſtarve: that which once we ſcorned, and condemned, and judged, (as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith) <hi>That which my Soul refuſed to touch, is made my ſorrowfull meat:</hi> We have no other ſtay and refreſhing, then theſe dry <hi>Husks,</hi> and it is a wonderfull thing, that we are not yet dead with ſuch unſavoury meat: It was a ſore day of
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:169498:176"/>
Famine with <hi>Job,</hi> when all was taken from him, all his <hi>friends, and children,</hi> and <hi>wife,</hi> and <hi>ſervants,</hi> and <hi>cattle,</hi> and he ſits on the Dunghill to ſcrape himſelf, and is caſt off by all, that he cryes out, <hi>My breath stinks and is corrupt, my breath is ſtrange to the wife of my boſome.</hi> This is a ſtrange turn for one who had ſeen ſo flouriſhing a day! and if you have never known plenty, you cannot ſo ſenſibly know want; but if you have indeed taſted of the <hi>rivers, the brooks of honey and Butter,</hi> (as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks) if you have ever <hi>taſted that the Lord is graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> and then come to be denyed, that will be the ſore Famine indeed: Oh how flouriſhing and green have we been in our young dayes! what powers and breakings of heart upon us! How could we have run barefoot, and broke through all blocks in our way to meet with the truth! but now how is all dead and ſtupid, and clung within! the inwards are ſhut up, that nothing can go down nor come to the heart to ſtrengthen and nouriſh: but we dye, and pine, &amp; famiſh, and walk about like ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, without any true life and motion: It was miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry enough to ſit by the rivers of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Zion,</hi> to them that were ſenſible of the loſs; they weep to think of <hi>Zion:</hi> but now to be an outcaſt from <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and all overſpread with the Leproſie too, to have a loathſom diſeaſe ſticking, that the breath muſt be ſtopt and kept from all ſociety, this is more miſerable ſtill: but then to be in a Famine too, that the Soul can turn no whither for bread, the <hi>Nobles come to the pit, and there is no water, the poore and needy ſeek water, and there is none,</hi> &amp;c. This is a wonderfull hard caſe indeed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Another miſery of theſe Lepers was, <hi>They were encamped round about with the hoſt of the Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> their enemies were all about them on every ſide, and though they were ſuch ſorry worthleſs things, ſo full of
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:169498:177"/>
woes, and miſeries, that it might ſcarce ſeem worth the while to kill them, yet they ſtand in great fear of their Lives too, leſt their enemies ſhould fall upon them, and ſlay them; for an Hoſt was now come forth, a ſworn company of profeſt enemies againſt all that belong to Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and have entred a League to cut off, and deſtroy both root and branch: and though the Soul be but as a dry leaf, a Partridge upon the mountains, a thing of no worth, as <hi>David</hi> pleads with <hi>Saul, Alas, againſt whom is the King of Iſrael come forth? againſt a flea?</hi> ſuch a ſorry thing as I am? So the Soul ſometimes pleads, alas, what a wretched creature am I! I am deſtitute of God and truth, ſhut out from his people, all overſpread with a loathſome Leproſie, ready to dye for hunger, dryed up to nothing with want and famine, and is not this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery enough? Is there need of other force and violence, an Hoſt to come againſt me? the Soul ſometimes ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly debates the Caſe, What is the meaning that all ſhould thus conſpire againſt a poor deſolate creature? a thing of nothing, a few ſorry Lepers that will ſoon dye of themſelves, though all ſhould let them alone? are you come out againſt me with Swords and ſtaves, (ſaith Chriſt?) alas they might have ſpared that labour, he was now in a moſt painfull agony, in a bloody ſweat, his Soul was ſorrowfull unto death, under the ſenſe and burthen of ſin, no need of a Sword againſt him. The Soul that is indeed ſenſible, knows and feels it is miſerable enough, though no enemy from without ſhould ever ſtrike a blow againſt it, to be <hi>void of God, a ſtranger to the Common-wealth of Iſrael,</hi> to be a <hi>Leper</hi> full of ſores, to be <hi>ready to ſtarve</hi> for hunger; is not here load enough? But to all theſe, to be in <hi>continuall fears of death</hi> from an Hoſt of enemies, who can utter the miſerie of this condition? Surely if the Lord remove us not
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:169498:177"/>
hence, we cannot long live, and continue here. But,</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Another thing conſiderable in their preſent condition, is, <hi>The lively ſenſe and feeling of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery:</hi> they were not aſleep, then the woe had been leſſe, but they feel where the ſhoe pinches, <hi>As for our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties we know them;</hi> the miſery and fears lie hard upon their Souls: <hi>If we ſit here we dye, and if we go into the City we dye, the famine is there:</hi> if we fall to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of our enemies, in all appearance we dye, they will ſurely kill us: <hi>a great Strait</hi> it is truly, if your Souls were ſenſible of it, to lie ſtill in a barren wilderneſs is to dye ſurely: and if you ſtir a foot, to get out, there are pits to fall into, and <hi>wilde beaſts</hi> ready to devour, and it is a thouſand to one, if one miſchief or other do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy. But all ſpoke in the general, I told you had no force nor power in it, if it come not home to us in our own conditions: therefore I ſhewed you how the Caſe was ours, we were the men, we are the Lepers. <hi>La.</hi> 3.1. <hi>I am the man that have ſeen affliction</hi> (ſaith <hi>Jeremy) by the rod of his wrath.</hi> I told you, 1. How we were out-caſts, cut off, caſt out from the common bleſſings which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to <hi>Iſrael:</hi> the word takes no effect, hearing &amp; ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and praying together, they take no place, touch not the heart, but all we get, is put into <hi>a bag of holes;</hi> It comes in at one ear, and goes out at another, nothing abides to be bleſt unto us: we ſaid in our proſperity, in the day of our flouriſhing, we ſhould never be moved, nor ſee ſorrow; I, but now how deſolate are we? voyd and deſtitute of all good? how do we ſit many a day, &amp; not one good and ſober thought doth paſſe through us? becauſe we ſit as outcaſts. 2. An evill diſeaſe hath taken hold of us, we are all overſpred with the leproſie, ſo that we cannot ſpeak nor have any dealings with one another
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:169498:178"/>
but we are in danger of being infected and tainted: whatever we do or ſay, or deſigne, <hi>a ſelfiſh taint</hi> get<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in, and ſpoils all: <hi>Let all your words be ſeaſoned</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle:) but how unſavoury a breath runs in all ours? unſavoury to our ſelves, and unprofitable, if not infecting to all that hear us. 3. The famine is ſorely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us alſo, and like to that which was in <hi>Samaria,</hi> a Famine that puts us to it ſo hardly, that we are made to eat our own children, the fruit of our own thoughts, and wiſdom, and reaſon; we have no <hi>Bread from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> now rained upon us, but Bread <hi>from the earth,</hi> that is from beneath, our own fleſhly thoughts and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells, we have nothing elſe in a Strait to refreſh our wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Souls withall: all is ſpent, and the <hi>Prodigall</hi> ſeeks to fill his belly with the Husks that the Swine eat, and they fail him alſo. 4. There is an Hoſt of enemies hath beſet us; Troops that continually ſeek our lives, and wait for our halting both from within and from without, and they threaten like <hi>Goliah,</hi> never to give over till they have given our fleſh to the beaſts of the field, and the fowls of the air, till they have undone us, when the poor ſoul ſits ſadly bemoaning it ſelf, <q>alas! I am an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt, ſhut out from the favour of God, and of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and am made to ſit alone in my chains. Alas! I am a Leper and unclean, <hi>My wounds ſtink and are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,</hi> a loathſome diſeaſe hath all over-run me, there is <hi>no ſound part from head to foot.</hi> Alas! I am ready to dye of the famine, the word takes no place: hearing is not bleſt to me, that which was once <hi>dearer then thouſands of Gold and Silver, ſweeter then the Hony, and Hony comb;</hi>
                     </q> more ſought for then neceſſary food: yet now all is gone, the Soul is empty and dry, and heartleſs: the famine hath conſumed all; and yet muſt an Hoſt too come againſt the Soul in this caſe?
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:169498:178"/>
this adds to all our miſery greatly. Here new fears per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex the Soul, leſt the enemy come unawares, and ſlay it: The Lepers know not what ſhall befall them, and they are ſenſible of all theſe miſeries now upon them. Alas! you that go and come, and ſit here as pictures, and are no more ſenſible then the ſtones in the wall, all this is nothing to you; and I am wondering ſometimes, how it is poſſible you ſhould thus ſleep away your time, and never conſider you are going apace to Hell and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but like the Smiths dog, ſleep quietly, though the ſparks fly about your ears: the words of the <hi>Curſe,</hi> and the words of the <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> all are al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But now you that are made ſenſible, and know where you ſtand, and cry for bread to eat, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that may cure and heal, and ſatisfie you every where, you that are under the ſenſe and pain of this felt-want and miſery, you clearly know theſe two things. 1. You ſee how an <hi>evill taint</hi> hath gone along with you all your dayes, from your <hi>childhood,</hi> which you never yet were cured of, and if you be not cured, it will ſurely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do you. And then, 2. We are under the ſenſe of the great thing we are ſhort of, of knowing the very inward mind and heart of God towards us, how we ſtand in that <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall favour</hi> of his, &amp; acceptance: for till we ſhall have a clear and full certainty, what theſe <hi>everlasting thoughts</hi> of God concerning us are; whatever elſe we have had, or may have, of powers, inlargings, refreſhings, and operations of truth, yet all will be too ſhort, to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and ſet down our Souls: we muſt ſtill lie, as the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers here did, at a peradventure and hazard, with our

Lives in our hands: <hi>They can but kill us, &amp;c.</hi> We know not what the end will be, how God will deal, whether ſave or deſtroy, but all our Life long we ſhall ſtand in fear of <hi>death,</hi> till we are freed from him that hath <hi>the power of Death,</hi> till we are ſatisfied by an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting witneſs of good-will towards us; and that <hi>nothing ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt:</hi> and to have the ſenſe of this ſhortneſs upon us, ſure it would make us ſtir and look about us. I wonder truly, how you can paſſe over a day, a night, an hour, and let the caſe lie at ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties, and that you are not alwayes crying out with theſe Lepers, <hi>If we ſit here, we dye!</hi> if we are not freed from this <hi>ſelfiſh taint,</hi> from an evil heart that hath ever been nurſed up with us, that will ſurely be our ruine: and if we are not in that eternall Good will of God favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and accepted, that <hi>love which ſtill cover a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſinnes,</hi> and never fail, but <hi>ſave to the utmost;</hi> if we are not found <hi>written in this book of life,</hi> we ſurely periſh. And can we lie in this miſerable condition, to be outcaſts, Leprous, under a ſore Famine, beſet round with an Hoſt of enemies, from within, and without, (for do you not ſee and know how the world are up, and ſtirred againſt us, if it be poſſible to break us in pieces, from being a people?) &amp; yet have we no ſenſe, nor feeling of all this?</p>
                  <p n="2">II. I told you a ſecond thing in generall to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, was, not only the preſent miſery theſe Lepers lie under, but <hi>the hopeleſs condition of any way or means to help them:</hi> They are at their wits ends; <hi>If we ſit here we dye; if go into the City, we dye; if fall into the Hoſt of our enemies, we can but dye,</hi> &amp;c. which implies they could promiſe and expect no other thing. And thus are our ſouls hemmed in with ſtraits on all hands. If we ſit where we are, we certainly know and feel we are
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:169498:179"/>
ſhort and periſh, and if we turn back to the world, and draw back from the place Truth hath brough us up unto, there we are ſure to periſh: and if we go on, an hoſt of enemies is before us, what ſhall we do in this Caſe!</p>
                  <p>There are three things which Truth hath ſurely led us up to, and if we go back again, and turn in any of thoſe Caſes, we are ſure to fall ſhort and dye.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As I told you, we are brought to a <hi>true light and information of our preſent miſery,</hi> in what a wretched, polluted, leprous caſe we ſtand, what a baſe ſelfiſh ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nt is with us in all our way, how ſhort we are of the <hi>life of God:</hi> and if we ſhall turn back from this, &amp; the heart be left to reaſon, and plead, and blind it ſelf, ſaying, <q>ſure I am not ſo miſerable, the caſe is not ſo bad, as <hi>I</hi> may judge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> and ſo ſhuffle away, and get off the ſtrait: This is to be undone, that is certain.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We are <hi>informed in the great thing we want,</hi> that without a <hi>clear and certain witneſs from heaven,</hi> ſealed upon our ſpirits, of the everlaſting thoughts of Good will towards us, that nothing elſe can be enough to ſtay and ſettle our Souls: this we are come to, to ſee nothing ſhort of this will ſerve: and this there is a true cloſe to, and cry for, at times, <hi>in our minds, in our inward man:</hi> However we are led captive, yet all along the eye is open to ſee what we want: and if here we ſhall be left to turn back, and reaſon with fleſh and blood, and ſay, all reach not to the ſame pitch: why may not we be ſaved, though we are not led up ſo far as ſome others? if we get off the ſtrait thus, and turn to careleſsneſs, and ſecurity; this is the way alſo ſurely to periſh.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We are brought to a <hi>Proclamation</hi> of, and have begun to enter into, a killing <hi>and ſelf-denying
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:169498:180"/>
way:</hi> the Proclamation hath ſounded to leave all things <hi>and take up the Croſſe,</hi> and follow Truth: <hi>not to pleaſe our ſelves,</hi> not to take content or ſit down in any of the creatures, not to have a Kingdom in this world, but to walk always as ſtrangers and pilgrims, ſeeking another country: this we have choſen according to our Light, and this we have profeſſed to the world, and if we ſhall be left to fall back here, and ſay, <q>This is a hard ſaying, who can bear it? <hi>to be ever dying,</hi> to be killed all the day long, &amp;c.</q> and ſo ſhall turn again to vanity, to the <hi>beggarly elements,</hi> to make a Captain, &amp; go back to <hi>Egypt, to turn with the dog to the vomit, &amp;c.</hi> I ſay, to be left to this, is a certain token of being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done. Many of you might have dyed in peace, and been truly ſaved formerly ſhort of this converſation, before the Light came up, and the thing was called for to leave all: but now to reſiſt, and withſtand the light that ariſes in your day, to rebell againſt the Lords call, this is certainly to be undone: and therefore if the Lord help you not out, and bring you not up to the next ſtep and buckle your hearts to the duſt, and make you lie under and ſubmit to the hand, and venture your lives, and ſay, <hi>Let him do what ſeemeth him good;</hi> without you come to this, you are undone: if you ſhall make a Captain to return into <hi>Egypt,</hi> then remember what befell, <hi>He ſware in his wrath, that they ſhould not enter into his reſt:</hi> and ſo they that were invited to the Feaſt, and draw back, and make excuſes, ſee what comes of it, he ſwears, <hi>they ſhall not taſte of his Supper.</hi> I could deſire you might never come hither to hear, unleſs there be a heart indeed to go on; it is not eaſie dallying with the truth, not like going to ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

nor found ſo guilty for not going on in the Truth; but it will not be ſo here, the Word will ſurely take place, and be either <hi>a ſavour of life to life, or of death unto death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus I have opened to you the preſent miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able condition the Lepers ſit in, and brought it home to our own caſe, and the caſe indeed is miſerable to ſit down in it; and if ever we riſe, it will be a wonderful recovery. You that are ſat down, O conſider, and think of it; for if you are left here, it had been good for you you had never been born. Then I have ſhewed you how they were hem'd in with Death; if they go back, they dye; if fall to their Enemies, in all appearance they dye. I apply'd it to our particulars, and ſhewed you three Things we were brought to, from which if we turn back, it is no leſs then Death. 1. We have ſeen the end of all the Doctrines of the world, an end of all the ways of falſe worſhip. 2. We know how we are ſhort, and what we want, and that nothing but a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, and clear evidence of the love of God opened and ſealed to our Souls, and that we may be made like to him, nothing elſe can ever content and ſatisfie us. 3. We are come to receive and entertain the Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſelf-denying way, to bid <hi>farewell</hi> to eaſe, and quiet, and ſelf-pleaſing, and take up the Croſs dayly; and if in any of theſe Caſes we fall back, we are ſurely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done. And now to ſpeak of the laſt Thing obſerved from the words.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. THE GREAT SUBMISSION AND BUCK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LING OF THEIR SPIRITS. <hi>Come, and let us fall into the Hoſt of the Syrians, for we can but dye. Can but dye!</hi> Alas, and is that little! How are their Souls ground to powder, and their hopes layd in the duſt,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:169498:181"/>
and they venture with their lives in their hands? In this Buckling of the Lepers, I would obſerve to you three Things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>They riſe:</hi> for they were ſet down; but are made to look about, and ſay, <hi>If we ſit here, we dye:</hi> And muſt they riſe now? This is a ſtrange time and caſe to ſtir in; what when out-caſts? when Lepers? when al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſtarved? when caſt off on all hands? I, now they riſe; need makes the naked man run: They do not ſtand to diſpute the caſe as our hearts ſometimes do; <q>Alas, I am unclean, and an out-caſt, and filthy, and ſhould I now look towards God?</q> But if the famine pinch'd you to the heart, it would make you up, and be going, and not reaſon the caſe, I am ragged, and torn, and uncomely; 'tis not a time to look for any meſſage from God, whileſt the caſe is thus with me. <hi>Alas! Hunger ſtands not upon manners</hi> and modeſty; it ſays, <hi>Give me bread, or I dye:</hi> The ſore famine buckles the heart, and makes it ſtoop to any thing: It turns to the hand that ſmites; it falls at the foot, and ſays, <hi>Let him ſay and do with me what ſeems him good; Lo here I am.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. In this ſubmiſſion of theirs, <hi>they fall into the Host of the Syrians;</hi> they fall upon the ſword. Now <hi>the Sword of the Spirit is the Word of God;</hi> with this it cuts, and divides, and pierces to the heart; and when the Soul is brought to this pinch, it bows indeed, it accepts of all; <q>Let him read, and ſay, and do what he will; let me hear all his mind, the judging part, the cutting part, that which moſt ſtrikes to the quick.</q> The heart is not now coy and nice, and ſtands upon thoſe terms of pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and chooſing; it ſays not, This is too ſharp, and the other too cruel; I cannot bear that hard ſaying, or the other dealing: No, but now <hi>to the hungry Soul every bitter thing is ſweet: Every word of God is good</hi> (ſaith
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:169498:181"/>
                     <hi>Agur.</hi>) And <hi>Paul</hi> under this buckling of heart cries out, <hi>The Law is holy, juſt and good, but I am carnal, &amp;c.</hi> Thus the Leper crouches down, and lays his neck to the block; if the ſword will ſpare it, well, if not, it lies to take the blow; <hi>I can but dye:</hi> and with <hi>Eſther, If I periſh, I periſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider the carriage of the Lepers in this great ſtrait: They ruſh not on furiouſly and deſperately, and ſay, Come, all ſhall be well; they take not the Kingdom by force; nor do they go utterly fainting and deſpairing, ſhutting out all hopes of their lives by hard concluſions: but with a <hi>ſober ſubmitted ſpirit they venture,</hi> ready to take up what ever befalls; b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> whether <hi>life,</hi> or whether <hi>death,</hi> that they leave, and conclude not the matter: And in this poſture doth the Soul truly buckled ever draw near to God. And therefore when ever you are upon your haſty concluſions one way or other, ſaying, Sure I ſhall come to nothing, or ſure all will be well with me; you ſay you know not what, both are alike falſe, and come not from a ſubmitted heart that ſtands in the ſtrait, and gives not up all for loſt in the worſt time. How did <hi>Joſephs</hi> Brethren expoſtulate the caſe, and plead with him when he ſeemed moſt harſh to them? and though they buckle and own, <hi>We are all my Lords bondmen, we are guilty;</hi> yet they plead, and hang on him, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give over; but, <hi>O my Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>Judah,) let thy ſervant I pray thee ſpeak a word in my Lords ears,</hi> &amp;c. This is a token of a Soul that is at a want indeed. Many talk of a Heaven, of a God, and of an eternal life, but 'tis but in way of complement, they are not at a want in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, their Souls are not fired with a <hi>thirſt for the living God;</hi> but want will carry through all. Though the Soul be an out-caſt, and the enemy reproach it, and upbraids, how ill it hath dealt with God, and how can it ever hope
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:169498:182"/>
for mercy? yet nothing can ſtop or hinder it; the needs preſs it on, and the noyſe continually rings in its ears, <hi>If we ſit here, we dye.</hi> Now for Uſe of this, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Do you indeed hear this voyce in your Souls, ever living, and ſpeaking, and giving no reſt, <hi>If I ſit here, I dye?</hi> O that it were the Lords will to thunder it in your ears, that you might ever hear it ſounding, <hi>If we ſit here, we dye!</hi> Who of you have attain'd to that certainty, that are ſure you ſhall never fall ſhort? There is a two-fold Death: A Death of your good, and light, and love, and enlargements, and attainments, that may be come to in the Truth; and here you that are to be ſaved may dye in this Wilderneſs: And there is an everlaſting Death, to be utterly cut off and ſeparated from God. And can you have any reſt till you are ſatisfied in both theſe, for your <hi>ſtate,</hi> and for your <hi>attainment?</hi> Can you get off from that voyce within you, <hi>If I ſit here, I dye?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. You that indeed hear this noyſe in your Souls, do you learn of theſe Lepers; venture into the hoſt, fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hand, let nothing keep you back; not becauſe you are forlorn, and miſerable, and all overſpread with ſin; ſhall this keep you back? But it ſhall not keep back all, ſome muſt enter and come as they are, in their rags and unclean garments; they muſt venture upon the <hi>ſwords point:</hi> and if ever you get bread, it muſt be this way; not by eaſe, and ſitting ſtill, and ſhunning ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: No, but by venturing into the midſt of the Hoſt, in taking up the Croſs dayly; not by picking and choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing here a bit, and there a bit; but if hungry indeed, the whole Lamb muſt down, and the bitter herbs; nothing muſt be too hard.</p>

The manner of theſe Lepers going without conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions one way or other, for or againſt themſelves; this may ſhew you the right way of coming at a <hi>peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> not propounding to our ſelves what will come on it, but to venture, and leave the ſucceſs to another, to lie before the ſword, and ſay, Let him do his pleaſure, <hi>Lo here I am, let him do what ſeems him good:</hi> If it pleaſe him, he is able, he can cure, and heal, and ſave us; but if not, lo here we ſtand in his preſence, and lie at his mercy.</p>

                  <p>In the concluſion he bows and buckles, and is ground under, and made to cry out, <hi>Thy Will be done.</hi> And in this ſaying there is ſo large, and vaſt, and deep a thing contained, that truly it ſwallows up all things elſe: Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and Earth, and all creatures are as nothing before <hi>this Will of God;</hi> All things muſt come to buckle, and be cruſht, and lie in the duſt before it! Alas, it will make the ſenſible heart to ſhake and tremble, and the ears to tingle, to hear and ſee what Chriſt here ſubmits unto, what he gives conſent to in ſaying this word, <hi>Thy Will be done!</hi> an unfathomed depth of ſubmiſſion and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of Soul lies up in it, to take up all ſufferings, and ſorrows, and miſeries that can befall.

I branched out the thing into ſeven Particulars, which Chriſt here ſubmits to, and to which all the ſaved ones muſt conſent, and follow in the ſame ſteps: In which ſeven particulars, ten thouſand miſeries and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are layd up, which no heart can conceive, nor tongue expreſs; what all they muſt paſs through that go to life, and ſhall be made to <hi>drink of the Brook in the way,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt <hi>lift up their heads.</hi>

In this ſaying, <hi>Thy Will be done,</hi> He ſubmits to be <hi>betrayed by one of his Diſciples;</hi> one of his own houſe lifts up himſelf againſt him, one that eat of his bread, and was his familiar friend; as 'tis expreſſed in the Pſalmiſt, <hi>We took ſweet counſel together, and walked in the Houſe of God as friends:</hi> And this is a wonderful miſery to take up; <hi>Had it been an enemy, I could have born it; but thou my friend, my familiar,</hi> &amp;c. This cuts to the heart: This very caſe befalls the Soul in which Truth is. There is ſomething that ſticks near to it, a friend that lies in its boſom, and is nurſed and favoured by it; ſomething that walks in the Houſe of God with it, and pretends to be for God, and Truth, and pleads hard, as if all were intended for the Souls good; and this will be a ſad day, when <hi>this very thing</hi> ſhall be found to be <hi>the Betrayer;</hi> and yet this Chriſt ſubmits to, when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, <hi>Thy Will be done.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. They are a <hi>multitude</hi> into whoſe hands he is betrayed: This flattering and ſmooth-mouth'd Betrayer, this <hi>Judas,</hi> that comes with a kiſs, and ſalutes, <hi>Hail Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> a great multitude is at his heels; he brings in a whole Troop after him.

For there is all this to be fulfilled, if you go in the ſame way with Chriſt, and tread in his ſteps, if you drink of the ſame Cup (as all the ſaved ones muſt;) for there is no other <hi>way to life,</hi> but <hi>to be planted into the likeneſs of his death;</hi> the likeneſs in all caſes, though not the very ſame particular Tryals that he had. And now this you ſhall find true, that when ever this <hi>Judas</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trays the Soul gets in, when by his counſel, or wiſdom, or flatterings, and fair promiſes, that curſed Betrayer gets in his foot, and deceives the Soul with a kiſs: then he lets in a multitude of enemies againſt us, then come in the ſwarmings of wickedneſs; <hi>They compaſſed me about like Bees</hi> (ſaith <hi>David:</hi>) Then come in all <hi>the floods of ungodlineſs,</hi> and make the Soul afraid; Then all <hi>the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the great deep</hi> are broke up, and come with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, ready to ſweep away all before them: Then <hi>the Sea brings forth abundantly all manner of creeping things;</hi> Then a night preſently overtakes the Soul, and <hi>all the beaſts of the Forreſt creep forth:</hi> Strange mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and things we never ſaw before; mire, and dirt, and ſtrange wickedneſſes appear, that we never thought had been in us. This Betrayer brings out all againſt us. We had thought we had been knowing, and well ſeen into the ways of God; but now <hi>ignorance,</hi> and <hi>miſts,</hi> and <hi>confuſion</hi> beſet, that the Soul cannot ſee nor know one diſtinct Truth. We had thought we had been good-natured, and tender-hearted, and friendly however; but now <hi>rage,</hi> and <hi>madneſs,</hi> and <hi>desperateneſs</hi> get up. We had thought ſure we had a will and deſire towards God, and were willing to be ruled and ordered by him; but now the <hi>punctual fightings,</hi> and <hi>oppoſings,</hi> and <hi>reſiſtings</hi> ſhew themſelves, that the Soul is made clearly to ſee, it chooſeth Death rather then Life: All monſtrous wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs gets up, when this <hi>ſon of perdition</hi> is to be revealed

in the Soul, and hath once betrayed it. I would you might read theſe things as we go, for all this a written for our learning; and <hi>if this was done to the green tree,</hi> then <hi>what ſhall be done to the dry?</hi> This is no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition then what hath befallen our fathers in their day: When God hath brought them to Judgment, and this work of bringing them <hi>through death to life</hi> was in hand, they ever had a Betrayer, that lay cloſe, and did them all the miſchief, and brought theſe Troops of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies againſt them; and it cannot be prevented: This <hi>ſon of perdition</hi> will thus act, he will betray and bring the Soul to death; and he lies cloſe: he is <hi>in all the ſaved ones;</hi> and there is no other <hi>way to life,</hi> but by <hi>having him caſt out:</hi> But he will firſt ſurely ſpit his poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and play all his pranks, if it were poſſible to undo the very Elect: Such an Hoſt, ſuch a multitude he brings with him, that ſometimes it agaſters and amazes the man to ſee how he is beſet, what ſwarms of iniquities &amp; ſtrange unthought of luſts appear. And we ſhall all ſurely find this true in our ſelves, when God ſhall have that work in hand, of bringing us down to death, <hi>(the houſe appointed for all the living,</hi>) which all the ſaved ones muſt paſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This multitude come armed and provided againſt him, <hi>with ſwords and ſtaves;</hi> and herein lies a great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, if you were able to read it: <hi>Thy rod and thy ſtaff ſuſtain me</hi> (ſaith <hi>David.</hi>) The Enemy alſo he hath ſwords and ſtaves to deſtroy; and mind, there are <hi>ſtaves</hi> as well as <hi>ſwords:</hi> Now ſtaves are dull weapons, and though they may bruiſe and batter, yet they kill not: and this is a great aggravation of the miſery, that the <hi>ſword</hi> may not come alone, ſuddenly to cut off, and make an end; but there are <hi>ſtaves</hi> too, that bruiſe and batter the Soul, and yet touch not its life; but it muſt hang in death: And this <hi>Job</hi> cries out againſt; <hi>O that I could

find the grave, then ſhould I be at reſt,</hi> I, but <hi>in thoſe dayes</hi> (it is ſaid,) <hi>men ſhall ſeek death, and it ſhall fly from them:</hi> They cannot dye: and this wonderfully adds to the miſery, that the Soul is wounded, and cut, and pierced, and yet cannot reach to dye: the ſtaves keep off the ſharpneſs of the Sword, that it doth not quite kill. The Sword of the ſpirit, is the Word of God; the <hi>true Light</hi> that the enemy makes uſe of, that ſearches, and cuts, and judges, and finds guilty every where, and leaves no thought unjudged: and this Sword would ſoon cut off, where it let looſe. <hi>Thou writeſt bitter things againſt me</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job:</hi>) and this, though it be cruell, yet it would ſeem eaſier to the Soul in that day, and under that anguiſh, if it might but go on to make an end: <hi>then ſhould I yet have comfort, &amp;c.</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) Iob</hi> 69, 10. But there are ſtaves too, that keep off the blow from coming to the heart. There are ſecret hopes from the Devil ſteal in, and get up, do the Soul what it can, that ſo it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not dye, but lies thus miſerably hattered to and fro, and can get no wayes, as <hi>David</hi> cries out, <hi>Thou haſt beſet me behind and before,</hi> that the Soul can neither get <hi>to God,</hi> nor <hi>from God,</hi> nor <hi>to death,</hi> nor <hi>from death.</hi> O Lord, who can read the Riddle!</p>

They bring him to the high Prieſt, and <hi>ſet him before a partial &amp; unequal judg</hi> that is ſet againſt him, and right or wrong will certainly do what he can to put him to death; and thus is the Soul dealt with, in this day, when it is betrayed into the hands of its luſts: They preſently lead and hale it to be judged by <hi>their own King,</hi> the Devil, he ſits in the ſeat of Judgement to hear and caſt the matter: he who never favoured Truth, was never a friend to it, <hi>but a murtherer from the beginning,</hi> ſeeking all wayes and means to deſtroy, yet <hi>He</hi> muſt now be <hi>Iudge,</hi> and condemn, and accuſe, and upbraid the Soul, <hi>in this day of its calamity.</hi> Now <hi>Shimei</hi> comes out, and upbraids, and curſes <hi>David, Come out thou bloody man:</hi> Now all the blood of <hi>Sauls</hi> houſe is come upon thee: Alas! there was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother hand in it, he was clear and innocent concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Sauls</hi> blood; he had ſpared his life, when it was in his hands to ſlay him, and had done good to <hi>Sauls</hi> houſe: but yet this falſe charge muſt be laid in his diſh, and he muſt bear the railing, and go away as guilty.

death againſt the Soul: how doth he beſtir him to prove, that all that ever the ſoul had or did, was but a deceit, and in hypocriſie, and no truth was in the bottome of it? <q>and this is a token you were a deceiver, (ſaith the Judg) and this proves you will come to nothing, you ever had a <hi>baſe taint</hi> in all you did, a baſe <hi>ſelfiſh end:</hi>
                     </q> and here the poore creature ſtands amazed, and ſilenced at theſe cruell charges, when preſently this wicked Judge is upon its back, and will not give a breathing time, but asks an anſwer: <hi>Anſwerest thou nothing to what theſe accuſe thee of?</hi> he calls for an anſwer in a moment: when the Soul ſtands amazed, and nonpluſt, and knows not how to get up a ſober thought, or word, at ſuch an inſtant, to plead for it ſelf, yet then they preſs to have the Sentence paſs againſt the Soul, as if there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of truth and ſingleneſs, but a diſſembling hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall heart in all.</p>

But now the Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Charge is never layd rightly and truly, for then the Enemy muſt accuſe himſelf, which he will never do: He never hits rightly on the ſore, where the Souls great woe, and miſery, and weakneſs lies, that is hid from theſe falſe Witneſſes; but they venture to ſpeak deſperate and punctual lyes, if it were poſſible to deſtroy the Soul by them: if you do but mind how the wheels move within, when ever the man is indeed put to a ſtrait, and ſtands in anguiſh, then the Lyar ſteps up, and witneſſes falſly; then they ſay (acted by this Spirit,) 'Tis <hi>you, Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron, that have made our ſavor ſtink in the noſtrils of Pharaoh and his ſervants, and you have brought us into this Wilderneſs to ſlay us with thirst:</hi> It was all falſe; they were ſent to be their Guides and Deliverers, to bring th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="361" facs="tcp:169498:190"/>
was open; and this Chriſt is made to ſubmit to, to have his Life taken from him unjuſtly, and without cauſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Another Thing Chriſt ſubmits to, when he ſays, <hi>Thy Will be done,</hi> is, to be put to the <hi>worſt and ſhamefulleſt death of all:</hi> The Circumſtances aggravate the Death. 1. He is crucified among <hi>two Thieves,</hi> as one of that company, guilty as they; <hi>He is numbered with tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors:</hi> The Truth ſuffers as guilty, though it be clear; <hi>as Deceivers, and yet true</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul.</hi>) Truth ſuffers between the <hi>Man</hi> and the <hi>Devil;</hi> they are the <hi>two Thieves.</hi> The <hi>Devil</hi> he is the great Thief; he ſteals to himſelf Lordſhip, and Power, and to ſit in the ſeat of God, and to be Diſpoſer of things; He brags and vaunts, <hi>All this will I give, if thou wilt fall down and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> &amp;c. Alas, they are none of his goods. Then the <hi>Man,</hi> he is a Thief too; he ſteals a little hope, and eaſe, and reſt, a little releaſe of his burthen when it preſſes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſore: and this Thief ſteals for his want to ſatisfie his hunger; and therefore he may be ſaved with Chriſt: But between theſe two the Truth muſt dye, as one of that number, as a ſinner and tranſgreſſor. We have looked amiſs, as if the <hi>man</hi> only and the <hi>Devil</hi> were to ſuffer; but the <hi>Truth</hi> in us, becauſe clear, therefore <hi>that</hi> might ſcape: No, no; that muſt ſuffer, and lead the way to the <hi>man,</hi> or elſe he alas can never ſuffer, nor go through death! But <hi>the good ſhepherd, when he puts forth his own ſheep, he goes before them;</hi> He ſuffers firſt, and drinks the firſt cup. But, 2. Where do they crucifie him? <hi>Out of the City,</hi> out of the place of bleſſing, and carry him to the <hi>place of a skull</hi> (as one of the Evangeliſts hath it,) <hi>a field of blood</hi> (as another calls it,) but by both it appears to be a loathſom, unworthy, diſgraceful place, a place of filth and rottenneſs: <hi>Out of the belly
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:169498:191"/>
of Hell have I cryed unto thee,</hi> &amp;c. No better a lodging for the Soul in this day, then the belly of Hell it ſelf; and this Chriſt ſubmits to. 3. Yet further, <hi>The Souldiers part his garments among them:</hi> And truly this is a very ſad caſe to conſider; How <hi>the Luſts,</hi> that crucified the Truth, yet they will divide its garments, and put them on, and they'l be covered with a garb and covering of Truth: The <hi>wiſdom of the fleſh</hi> that puts in for a ſhare; the haſty and eager <hi>zeal and affections</hi> they plead for a ſhare, the <hi>ſtrange imaginations</hi> they plead a ſhare; and all will ſeem to be Friends to Truth, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they have but now put it to death; yet they part his garments among them. And this is a ſad caſe to the ſenſible Soul that is bereaved of the Life of its Truth, and of the <hi>garments</hi> alſo, that hath loſt all; ſuch a Soul can cry out bitterly with <hi>Mary, They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have layd him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Yet further, He ſubmits to be <hi>left and forſaken of all his Friends;</hi> His Diſciples left him and fled: Might he but have had them to ſtick to him in this day of his calamity, it had been a great ſupport and ſtay; but they all leave him, and are <hi>ſcattered eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one to his own:</hi> And herein lies a ſore aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of miſery, (if your Souls can read it,) that now in this woful day, when all theſe woes are upon the back, and preſs the Soul to death almoſt, yet this muſt come in, to add to all the reſt, That all the good that ever the Soul hath done, and thought, and laboured in the Truth, all is now ſcattered, and leaves it: What ever it hath done, ſingly and honeſtly, and out of the <hi>good-will ſown in its heart</hi> towards the Truth, <hi>all the labours under the Sun</hi> now take their leave, and ſeem <hi>vanity and vexation of ſpirit:</hi> And here Chriſt cries
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:169498:191"/>
out, <hi>I have ſpent my labour in vain:</hi> time will come, you will forget that ever you had a good thought, or a good word or did any thing for the Truth; all wil leave you and be gone: when now your Souls can ſometimes hold on the <hi>innocency</hi> and <hi>ſingle mindedneſs</hi> within, and truly pray to be remembred according to that <hi>inward clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> yet a day will come when all this will be laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and forgotten; <hi>I forgot proſperity</hi> (ſaith <hi>David:</hi>) and in another place, he compares himſelf to the <hi>Dead that are forgotten for ever:</hi> How had Chriſt once his Diſciples about him, and ready to his command, when he ſent out the Seventy two by two! and now to be left of all, and not one to ſtand by him, this is a hard Trial: and if it were not hid from the Soul, if it could foreſee what a day of Scattering of all its good and labours would come upon it, as though they had not been, it would diſcourage and make it flag in all its act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for God, if it thought ſuch a day of ſtripping all were to come. <hi>They pierced my hands, and my Feet,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt;) His <hi>Hands</hi> that had laboured in the Truth, and his <hi>Feet</hi> that had <hi>ran the way of his Commandments:</hi> Theſe are now nailed faſt to the Croſs, and he is not able to ſtir them. The day will come when your Souls will <hi>hate all the Labours you have taken under the Sun;</hi> when that Strait ſhall be upon you, to crie out, <hi>My God, My God, Why hast thou forſaken me!</hi> (Mark what I ſay, for the day will ſurely come upon you) and then all your Works and Labours will leave you: All the good that ever hath paſſed upon you will not ſtand you inſtead in <hi>that day,</hi> nor anſwer <hi>that Strait.</hi> O Lord! how is my Soul troubled, when I feel how ſenſeleſſe you are, and far off from having the thing ſeiſe upon you indeed? But it will ſurely come, and then you will remember
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:169498:192"/>
what hath been told you; this Condition will befall you, to be <hi>left alone,</hi> as Chriſt complains, <hi>Lover, and Friend haſt thou put far from me, and my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance into darkneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Another miſery greater then all, is this, <hi>His fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hides his face</hi> from him, he ſeems to forſake him, and become an enemy, that he cries out, <hi>my God, my God, &amp;c. My God,</hi> he can yet ſay, but not <hi>my father,</hi> he hath hid himſelf from the houſe of <hi>Jacob,</hi> all the bowels are hid. But why muſt this befall Chriſt, that his father leaves him?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He hides himſelf, <hi>that he may not ſee the death of his childe,</hi> the father cannot endure that; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he turns aſide, and hides his face, his bowels and tenderneſs, and puts on another habi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>: <hi>Cloaths him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with vengeance, as with a garment:</hi> when this work of <hi>death</hi> muſt paſs, then he ſeems all anger, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens himſelf againſt the cries, and tears of his <hi>Son;</hi> then he comes with <hi>Refiners fire:</hi> now the fire, that hath no mercy, it burns all alike that comes nigh it: and here <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> cries out, <hi>Haſt thou forgotten to be gracious? Haſt thou ſhut up thy loving kindneſs in displeaſure?</hi> The Soul wonders at this day, and is amazed what work is in hand: It is hemm'd in wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h darkneſs and gloomineſs, and all things work againſt it, and God he withdraws, and leaves it: <hi>the Father</hi> lays aſide all his bowels, and falls upon his <hi>Iſaac</hi> to bind him, and lay him upon the Altar for a Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He hides himſelf, that <hi>the Son may learn obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience by the things he ſuffers:</hi> for nothing in the world ſeizeth ſo deep upon the ſenſible Soul, as this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God: when God is indeed made precious, and the Soul hath left all, and made choyce of him onely; then to be left and forſaken, O how it grindes the heart,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:169498:192"/>
and lays it in the duſt! The Soul is like a <hi>fooliſh childe,</hi> that ſo long as the mother is preſent joys and fliggers greatly; but let his mother depart and leave it, and then how doth it penſie and ſink, and nothing will pleaſe it! So when all ſight of God is gone, that the Soul can ſee no more of him, O how doth it ſeize and buckle to the duſt! Then the Soul cries to all things, <hi>Labor not to comfort me;</hi> let me dye in my ſorrow: It learns by this want to want all things.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He hides himſelf, that <hi>Death may ſeize and take place:</hi> for God, ſhould he always be preſent, and uphold with his love and favor, it were impoſſible to dye. How have the Saints ſung and rejoyced in ſtocks, and priſons, and fires? nothing could terrifie nor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright: why, God was preſent, and that kept them up. He walked in the fire with the <hi>three children,</hi> and ſo long the fire cannot burn, nor ſeize at all. <hi>Martha</hi> ſays to Chriſt, <hi>Lord, hadſt thou been here, my Brother had not dyed.</hi> And certain it is, were but God with us, we could not be in that darkneſs and confuſion, in thoſe ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and wants, and perplexities, that now are upon us; but he withdraws on purpoſe that the blow may ſeize. Do you know what this means? and what a bitter cup this will be to drink of? when the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> are upon you, and the Lord he is departed! To be betrayed by a neer and boſom friend, to be given into the hands of ſinners, to be unjuſtly put to death, to be numbered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Tranſgreſſors, and left of all friends that ever ſtood by us; and then to add to all the reſt, to have God withdraw too, and hide all love and favor, and ſtop his ears, and ſeem an enemy; O who can expreſs the miſery! <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me!</hi> The Soul cannot get from <hi>my God:</hi> How ever it is delt with, though a <hi>Father</hi> be gone and hid, yet it cannot
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:169498:193"/>
go to another God, though it periſh.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The ſeventh aggravation of this miſery, to which Chriſt ſubmits, is this, <hi>He muſt be dumb,</hi> and not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his mouth in all theſe ſufferings; <hi>as a ſheep dumb before the ſhearer:</hi> He muſt not complain, nor repine, nor ſtruggle, nor reaſon the caſe: He muſt not ask and cry for any eaſe and favor, but be ſtill, and let all the waves go over him: He may not have ſo much liberty as the <hi>rich man</hi> had in Hell; he could call out to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> for water to cool his tongue; but he muſt be in the fire, and yet not cry out, but bear it in ſilence: and how hard a leſſon is this, to have no vent in miſery? not to complain, nor ſo much as ask pity! but this Chriſt ſubmits to, and all your Souls muſt come to it, that ſhall enter into Life. And there are three Reaſons for it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He muſt be dumb, that he may <hi>ſtand to his word,</hi> and make that good: He had conſented and ſpoke the word, <hi>Thy Will be done;</hi> and he ſhould now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict himſelf, and his heart would reproach his mouth (as <hi>Job</hi> ſays) if he ſhould ſhrink away, and complain; for this was, to have His Will done, and not Gods.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He muſt be dumb, that he may <hi>give no ill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to others:</hi> He is called <hi>the Lamb without ſpot;</hi> no flaw muſt be in the Truth: If the Captain turn his back, alaſs, this would ſoon diſhearten all his Souldiers! If he ſhould complain and murmur, who would not learn murmuring, and ſtand to plead for it? 'Tis certain we learn evil one of another; if we ſee another break out frowardly under a croſs, we preſently learn to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly and froward: <hi>With the froward thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf froward.</hi> But now he muſt bear the hand quietly, and meckly, and patiently, to leave a good example for his people to walk in the ſame ſteps.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He is dumb, that he may not <hi>forfeit all his
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:169498:193"/>
work,</hi> and loſe all his reward: <hi>One dead fly ſpoyls the whole box of ointment;</hi> And <hi>he that keeps the whole Law, and fails in one point, is guilty of all:</hi> Not to go quite through with the work, is to loſe all; and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain and murmur, that is to fly from the hand, and ſhrink from the work; and that would hinder the reward, and be recorded for an evil: Amongſt all the other good, yet this comes in as a flaw; <hi>In this thou haſt done fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhly.</hi> And thus you may ſee a <hi>picture of Chriſt upon the Croſs:</hi> but you cannot feelingly know the thing, till you ſhall come to the execution of it upon your ſelves, and feel the ſame in all theſe particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then for Uſe, conſider, Do you beleeve ever to ſee this day? or do you think to come in at ſome other door? I wonder where your thoughts are! ſure you do not beleeve that ever this condition ſhould be yours: If you beleeve it, you will be ſearching and enquiring, <q>But what is my <hi>Judas?</hi> what is that falſe boſom com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion that will prove my Betrayer? where lies that <hi>darling-viper?</hi> Is it in my Underſtanding, my Light? Am I holding and boaſting of my knowledg ſecretly? Or is it in my affections? in the love, and choyce, and cleavings of my heart to any ſeen thing? and will that be a Traytor to me? Where lurks the Thief? under what habit goes he? Is he betraying with kiſſes, with tenderneſs, and love, and inward pleaſings of ſpirit, where I leaſt ſuſpect him? Is he in my eaſe, and reſt, and content? Is it he that keeps the bag, and is the overſeer and provider of all things needful for me, which ſeems the neereſt friend, and moſt careful for my good?</q> Is the Traytor ſo nigh me? 'Tis time to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire; for certainly if ever you enter into Life, you muſt paſs the ſame way; and you will meet with a <hi>Judas</hi> that will be your death, one that lies cloſe and hid; and the
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:169498:194"/>
man little ſuſpects him to be who he is: but 'tis ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>He knew from the beginning who ſhould betray him. Truth</hi> in us, from the firſt day, we can remember, hath ever diſ-reliſhed him, and found an evil ſavor in all that he hath done or ſaid: therefore enquire out the thing; for what ever it be, whether wiſdom, or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, or honor, or eaſe, or outward enjoyments, or huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, or wife, or childe, or what ever elſe; yet certain a Thief is got in, and lodges nigh all of you, in your very boſoms, that will betray you.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If you are informed you muſt paſs this way and no other, then let it not ſeem ſtrange when it comes to paſs: when a multitude ſhall be about your ears, floods and ſwarms of ungodlineſs, that agaſter and amaze the Soul, will appear, hidden and unthought of <hi>depths of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> and all, that <hi>man</hi> may appear to be a <hi>meer nothing,</hi> and <hi>Sin</hi> may appear <hi>exceeding ſinful,</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> may appear to be <hi>Grace indeed.</hi> All your fair carriages, and wiſdom, and moderation will be found to be a ſtinking puddle, and defiled. If you have found another way to life, I would you could declare it; but if there be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſure it will put your Souls to a ſtrait, to look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout where you are: How do you think to ſtand in that Day, when he ſhall riſe <hi>to ſhake terribly the Earth?</hi> If you are not then found in thoſe <hi>everlaſting records,</hi> if not a Name written in the <hi>Book of Life;</hi> if there be not another <hi>ſpirit</hi> in you, that can go through the fire, that cannot dye, that it is impoſſible it ſhould be holden of the grave; Then what will become of you in that Day!</p>
